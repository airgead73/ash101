    <p class="txt">Mr. Belknap had a vision. Perhaps not a soaring, poetic, or musical vision such as that of the teacher of which Kahlil Gibran speaks. His was a more earthly vision&#8212;a vision that saw all his eager little seventh graders mastering the state-mandated standards that define the mathematics curriculum. He dreamed that when they finally took the compulsory year-end, tests, their marks would astonish his colleagues, the principal, his mother, the superintendent, and the committee that grants the coveted Master Teacher awards.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are uses and types of placement assessment?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Mr. Belknap didn't win the award that year; too many of his little charges struggled mightily with their fractions and ratios.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-body">
	   
       <div class="single-column">		  
		  <p class="txt">The problem that first year, he explained, was not that his instructional approach was any less inspirational and inspired than when he finally did win the award. Nor was his mastery of pedagogical skills any less. As the superintendent himself put it during the Master Teacher award ceremony banquet, &quot;From the very first year, I've seen firsthand just how good Mr. Belknap is with the questions and the hints and the directions and all the clever teaching stuff, you know, so good with the <em>formative assessment</em>. Yes!&quot;</p>

		  <p class="txt">The issue that first year had to do not with formative assessment but rather with <em>placement</em> assessment. Recall that formative assessment is typically informal assessment that occurs during instruction and is designed to improve the teaching&#8211;learning process. Placement assessment, on the other hand, is a form of preassessment. That is, it occurs prior to instruction and is used to make decisions about the placement of learners.</p>

		  <p class="txt">The issue with Mr. Belknap's first seventh-grade class was that the school had not yet implemented use of the placement assessments, the well-known DIBELS system (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills). These are a series of commercially available, standardized measures and procedures for assessing K&#8211;6 literacy skills, often used to identify students who might benefit from more intensive language instruction. Instruments such as these can be especially useful in helping ELL students improve language literacy.</p>        
      </div>

	  <div class="inner-section">
	  <h2 class="h2">Uses of Placement Assessment</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
		  <p class="txt">By definition, placement assessment occurs before assignment of the learner to a class, group, or program of studies. Information from placement assessment may be used as a basis for making two different kinds of decisions.</p>
		  <ol class="nl">
			<li class="li_text"><em>Selection decisions.</em> Should the applicant be accepted in the drama program? Is the student a suitable candidate for a postgraduate course? Is the candidate likely to make a good airline pilot? Can he meet the physical challenges of a police officer's role? Can she develop the skills required of a neurosurgeon? Is he a candidate for an enriched kindergarten literacy program? Is she likely to benefit from further equine dentistry training?</li>
			<li class="li_text"><em>Placement decisions</em>. In which reading group should Kain be placed? For what level hockey team should Sonia play? Which of the newly arrived immigrants would benefit from intensive language and literacy instruction?</li>
		  </ol>

			</figcaption>
		  </figure>
	  <div class="single-column">	  
         <p class="key-point">Assessments used for placement decisions often suggest where student deficits lie and what might be done to remediate them. They can also uncover uncommon strengths and suggest placement in advanced classes or some other form of enrichment or acceleration.</p>	  
		  <p class="txt">Both of these possibilities are likely to improve teaching and learning outcomes&mdash;which is precisely what formative assessment is intended to do.</p>
		  <p class="txt">Different kinds of tests might be used for placement assessments, including professionally developed <strong>standardized tests</strong> as well as <strong>teacher-made tests</strong>.</p>
	  </div>
	  </div>

	  <h2 class="h2">Standardized Tests</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
		  <p class="txt">Standardized tests are available for a wide range of subjects and purposes (see Chapter 10). For example, many universities use tests such as the SAT or the ACT as a basis for making admission decisions (College Board, 2018).</p>
		  <p class="txt">SAT originally stood for Scholastic Aptitude Test or Scholastic Assessment Test. It was later known as the SAT Reasoning Test, but it is now generally simply called the SAT. It looks at performance in mathematics, writing, and critical reading. It takes some three hours to complete and is administered at a cost of &#36;45 per examinee. Practice tests are free and are available online.</p>
		  <p class="txt">Slightly more widely used than the SAT is the ACT, which consists of four sections of tests including English, Mathematics, Reading (including social sciences), and Science Reasoning. Like the SAT, it is intended to provide an indication of test takers' suitability for college-level work.</p>
		  <p class="txt">Another example of a standardized placement test is the High School Placement Test (HSPT; Scholastic Testing Service, 2018). Many schools use this test as a basis for decisions about promotion from eighth to ninth grade. The DIBELS is yet another widely used standardized measure of early literacy, especially useful for placement of ELL children.</p>	  
	  </div>

	  <a id="p184"></a>	 
	  <div class="inner-section">
	  <h2 class="h2">Teacher-Constructed Placement Tests</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
		  <p class="txt">In addition to choosing from a wealth of standardized tests, educators often rely on teacher-made summative tests that they use for placement purposes. For example, once Andre&#39;s teacher has completed all her fourth-grade assessments, she might use Andre&#39;s final grades as a basis for a series of consultations with school administrators and with Andre&#39;s parents. The purpose of these meetings might be to determine the best placement for him the following year.</p>
		  <p class="txt">Also widely used for placement purposes, <em>diagnostic assessments</em> are commonly considered a form of preinstruction placement assessment. Diagnostic assessment is designed mainly to identify learner strengths and weakness.</p>
		  <p class="txt">The distinction between placement and diagnostic assessments in education has to do with their emphases. Both placement and diagnostic assessments identify strengths and weaknesses to determine readiness levels and appropriate placements; hence, both can serve the same purposes. However, assessments that are primarily diagnostic focus on identifying learning difficulties or advantages and on determining appropriate interventions for selected learners; placement assessments are directed more toward sorting learners for grouping purposes. Instruments and approaches that are used mainly for diagnostic assessments are discussed later in this chapter.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
         <p class="intro">As we saw in earlier chapters, the most useful educational assessment is the type that assists learning. That, in a nutshell, is a simple definition of what is termed <em>formative assessment</em>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-body">
    <h2 class="h2">Formative Versus Summative Assessment</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <p class="txt">Formative assessment is often contrasted with summative assessment. Summative assessment is designed mainly to provide a summation of learner progress and achievement&#8212;hence the term <em>summative</em>. Formative assessment, on the other hand, is designed mainly to improve and foster progress and achievement. In a sense it forms (or informs) learning and instruction&#8212;hence the term <em>formative</em>.</p>

		<h4><button class="ec_expand" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ecbox5-1">LEARN MORE</button></h4>
		<div id="ecbox5-1">
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Put another way, formative assessment is <strong>assessment for learning</strong>; in contrast, summative assessment is assessment <em>of</em> learning. Formative assessment typically occurs during learning, whereas summative assessment occurs after instruction. Also, formative assessment usually requires that learners be centrally involved with the teacher in interpreting and using the results of ongoing informal assessments. In contrast, learners tend to be much less involved in the interpretation and use of summative assessments.</p>

				</figcaption>
			</figure>
          <div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">A common way of explaining formative assessment is to describe it in terms of the many ways teachers and learners have of <strong>checking for understanding</strong> (Fisher &#38; Frey, 2007). However, as we saw in Chapter 4, the term <em>understanding</em> is perhaps too narrow in this context. Ideally, our formative assessments check not only for understanding but also for a variety of other cognitive skills, such as those involved in analyzing, evaluating, creating, and applying.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Components of Formative Assessment</h2>    
	<div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">When using formative assessments, teachers are making an ongoing appraisal of student learning&#8212;and by the same token, an evaluation of instructional approaches. The appraisal is intended to identify competencies and difficulties among individual learners and to assess the effectiveness of instructional approaches.</p>    
		
		<p class="key-point">That is, good formative assessment differentiates among learners.</p>     

        <p class="txt">The goal is to identify and to implement the most effective instructional strategies and methods for particular learners, given their current skills and knowledge and in light of clear learning objectives. Instructional objectives that both teachers and learners clearly understand are absolutely essential for good formative assessment.</p>

		 <p class="txt">In practice, formative assessment can be simplified in terms of an iterative (repeating) cycle involving three sequential components: gathering relevant information, using this information as feedback for both teachers and learners, and adjusting instruction and learning (see Figure 5.1). These three components of formative assessment, explains Alonzo (2017), give rise to three basic questions: What information needs to be collected? How can that information be collected? How should that information be used?</p>

	</div>
	<div class="section-lead">
        <p class="intro">Feedback&#8212;meaning the information that teachers and learners receive about their performance&#8212;is central to formative assessment.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section-body">
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">In most types of formative assessment, feedback is not a test score. Rather, it is a brief evaluation of learning&#8212;and also of teaching&#8212;integrated directly into the instructional process and purposely designed to guide changes that will foster and improve learning.</p>
			<p class="txt">For example, Fabiano, Reddy, and Dudek (2018) illustrate how feedback can often take the form of <em>coaching</em>, in which the teacher's interventions focus on immediate, ongoing student behaviors and are designed to improve student performance. Moreover, feedback in education does not just mean information that learners receive from the teacher; it also includes information the teacher receives from learners&#39; responses and behaviors.</p>
		</div>

		<a id="p187"></a>	 
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">Characteristics of Good Feedback</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">The kind of feedback that is most useful in formative assessment has a number of important characteristics.</p>
			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">It relates to clear instructional objectives. Assessments that are unrelated to a clear view of learning objectives are not usually very useful.</li>
			<li class="li_text">It encourages self-assessment. Self-assessment is basic to the development of self-regulated learners. These are learners who are empowered to set their own goals and direct their efforts toward these goals, and they have developed the skills required to monitor and evaluate their progress and adjust their efforts accordingly.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Good formative assessment feedback promotes teacher&#8211;learner and learner&#8211;learner interaction. This is in direct contrast with summative assessment, which does not usually involve the student directly. Formative assessment requires that both the learner and the teacher be involved in interpreting and applying the feedback that results from ongoing evaluations. And both parties are centrally involved in efforts to improve learning.</li>
			<li class="li_text">It enhances motivation and builds self-esteem.</li>
			<li class="li_text">It is specific and easily understood by learners. Bhagat and Spector (2017) point out that the best feedback needs to be <em>informative</em> for the learner, as well as timely. Feedback is often too abstract and too far removed from the learner&#39;s immediate experience to be very useful.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Most important, good formative assessment feedback shapes both teaching and learning, and it is explicitly geared toward achieving instructional objectives. In contrast, summative assessment is directed toward determining how well instructional objectives have been met rather than toward increasing their attainment.</li>

		<h2 class="h2">The Feedback Loop</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Feedback has often been described as a loop or a circle, in which a system (or an organism) carries out some action, receives information about the effects of the action, evaluates those effects in terms of desired outcomes, and modifies the action as necessary. Feedback in formative assessment is basically the same. Teachers and learners engage in certain actions; through formative assessment, both receive evaluative information (feedback) about the effects of their actions; this information is used to modify and improve actions as necessary. This process defines the use of feedback in formative assessment.</p>
			<p class="txt">The process, which is shown in Figure 5.2, is well illustrated in a study conducted by Hooshyar and associates (2016). These investigators developed an online game-based tutoring system for teaching computer programming to a group of 58 university students. The central feature of this tutoring system was that it provided immediate, detailed feedback for every student response. This type of formative assessment feedback, coupled with the highly motivating qualities of online gaming, resulted in significantly improved learning.</p>

		<h2 class="h2">Using Feedback</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Formative assessments can offer a wide range of different kinds of information, all directed toward providing the sort of feedback that will be most useful in improving learning. For example, information (feedback) from observation of student performance might be used to gauge learner understanding and progress. Similarly, learner responses to informal quizzes and ongoing questioning might quickly reveal details of progress, or lack thereof, toward learning objectives.</p>

			<a id="p189"></a>
			<p class="key-point">Thus, formative assessments allow both teachers and learners to adjust their approaches while in the process of teaching and learning.</p>
			<p class="txt">Formative assessment feedback can also provide information useful for evaluating the characteristics of an entire class. Such information might answer questions such as: What are the learners' principal needs? Their most compelling interests? Their greatest strengths?</p>
			<p class="txt">Feedback often suggests strategies for encouraging learners to assess their own progress and achievements. For example, many approaches to formative assessments encourage learners to keep track of and think about their own learning, perhaps in the form of portfolios&#8212;physical or electronic records of progress and achievement in an area. (See Chapter 7 for a discussion of portfolios and other kinds of performance assessments that can be used for formative assessment.)</p>
			<p class="txt">Formative assessment feedback can also be useful as a teaching&#8211;learning tool. For example, when Mrs. Yi asks her seventh graders to make up test items for a mathematics unit that can then be administered to the entire class, one of her goals is to promote among her students a greater understanding of their own learning and of how it can be monitored and evaluated. And when they are later asked to respond to some of these items and given feedback about their responses, much of the feedback they receive might lead to improvements in learning (see <em>In the Classroom: Prompts as Feedback in Formative Assessment</em>).</p>

		<p class="txt">In construction a cornerstone is found at the intersection of two walls. Historically, it was the first stone laid by the stonemason. As a result, it assumed enormous importance because all the other stones would now need to be laid relative to this cornerstone. Not surprisingly, the term has come to mean something that is extremely important; something that is basic or essential.</p>
		<p class="txt">Feedback is the cornerstone of formative assessment. It is essential to its defining purpose: namely, to enhance learning and instruction.</p>
		<p class="txt">A great deal of formative assessment feedback comes from informal <strong>prompts</strong>, many of which can be phrased as questions&#8212;the sorts of questions that check for learning. Literally, a prompt is an assist or an encouragement. To prompt is to help. Questions like these are prompts: Is that the only comparison you can make? What would you do next? Have you tried using the mouse? Are you sure that answer is correct? Can you think of another explanation? What if you used your other hand?</p>
		<p class="txt">Feedback is implicit in most of these prompts. For example, &quot;What would you do next?&quot; implies an informal assessment that indicates that the task is not complete. At the same time, it prompts&#8212;or suggests&#8212;that the learner should consider another action. And perhaps another prompt is now in order: Have you thought about what would happen if both boxes were full?</p>		
		<p class="txt">A feedback prompt is intended to close the gap between the student&#39;s current performance and the instructional objectives. Different kinds of prompts can be used forthis purpose: reminders (Do it like you did it last time); examples (Use the model on the screen); directions (Put your left foot farther out); unfinished questions (The name of the city is . . .?); reflection prompts (How can you make sure you remember?), and others.</p>
		<p class="txt">The important point is that to be effective, formative feedback prompts need to reflect ongoing, minute-to-minute assessments and must assist the learner&#39;s progress toward instructional objectives.</p>

		<h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How is formative assessment implemented?</span></h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section-lead">
        <p class="intro">Formative assessment is assessment that occurs during instruction. It typically involves feedback for both teachers and students.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section-body">
		
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Furthermore, the feedback given to the learner as a result of formative assessment is often qualitative; it involves verbal appraisal or nonverbal signs of approval, disapproval, frustration, happiness, and so on; it does not involve scores or grades.</p>
			<p class="txt">The Glossary of Educational Reform (2014) defines formative assessment as &quot;a wide variety of methods that teachers use to conduct in-process evaluations of student comprehension, learning needs, and academic progress during a lesson, unit, or course&quot; (para. 1). Assessment is truly formative, explain Black and Wiliam (2009), when it actually changes the teacher&#39;s behavior in response to the learner&#39;s needs and when, as a consequence, it affects the student&#39;s learning.</p>
			<p class="key-point">Formative assessment is not a specific form of testing but rather a way of gathering and using information to enhance both teaching and learning during an actual instructional sequence.</p>
			<p class="txt">In essence, it is an approach marked by the teacher&#39;s attempts to understand how students learn and to develop interventions to improve their learning.</p>
			<p class="key-point">Therefore, formative assessment is an integral part of the teacher&#39;s day-to-day activities, rather than a specific add-on.</p>
			<p class="txt">The most important first step in implementing formative assessment, say Noyce and Hickey (2011), is to determine what you want students to learn. As we saw, formative assessment isn&#39;t very valuable if learning objectives are unclear for the teacher. It may be even less valuable if instructional objectives are unclear for the learner.</p>

			<a id="p191"></a>
			<p class="txt">Teachers then need to figure out what tools (like computers) and approaches (like observing, questioning, quizzing, and watching) they can use to gather information that will inform both the teacher and the learner about student progress. The information gathered might take the form of words, pictures, actions, a variety of computer-generated products, or student performances of different kinds.</p>
			<p class="txt">Finally, teachers (and learners) need to determine how the information can be put to best use to improve both instructional strategies and learning (which go hand in hand). In a sense formative assessment becomes a vehicle for the teacher&#39;s professional development in the same way that it supports student learning.</p>

		<h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the principal approaches to formative assessment?</span></h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section-lead">
        <p class="intro">Formative assessments can take a variety of forms, ranging from highly informal to more formal approaches.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section-body">
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Formal assessments are generally defined as systematic measurements of student achievement and progress. They can be based on teacher-made or professionally developed instruments and are clearly illustrated by end-of-term final exams.</p>
			<p class="txt">Informal assessments include the wide range of teacher and learner behaviors that are used for assessment purposes on a daily basis. For example, informal assessments might take the form of spontaneous questions and answers during class presentations, brief quizzes, or ongoing evaluations of student work in the classroom. However, distinctions are not always clear; formal and informal assessments often overlap.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">More Informal Approaches: Dialogue, Demonstration, and Observation</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">As Klenowski (2009) puts it, &quot;Assessment for learning is part of everyday practice by students, teachers, and peers that seeks, reflects upon, and responds to information from dialogue, demonstration, and observation in ways that enhance ongoing learning&quot; (p. 264). The wording of this definition suggests that information gathered for assessment can come from three distinct sources: dialogue, demonstration, and observation.</p>		
			<h3 class="h3">Dialogue</h3>		
			<p class="txt">Information based on dialogue derives mainly from the learner's oral and written verbalizations. These might take the form of responses to a teacher's questions. They might also be spontaneous verbalizations. For example, when Mr. Coleman hears Juanita whispering to Jasmine, &quot;What does <em>dividend</em> mean?,&quot; he is being provided with feedback that immediately tells him that Juanita lacks an important understanding in her learning progression. Mr. Coleman must now determine why this is so and decide what steps can be taken to help Juanita learn what a dividend is.</p>

			<a id="p192"></a>
			<h3 class="h3">Demonstration</h3>
			<p class="txt">Information for formative assessment might also be based on demonstration. As we will see in Chapter 8, demonstrations are an important part of what is called <em>performance assessment</em>&#8212;assessment of learners' actual behavior. For example, performance assessments in a drama class studying <em>A Raisin in the Sun</em> might be based on the student's portrayal of Walter Lee Younger during a rehearsal. Teacher reactions such as evaluative comments, suggestions, prompts, and questions illustrate the kind of feedback that defines formative assessment.</p>
			<p class="txt">In most cases formative assessment based on demonstrations is unstructured and spontaneous. For example, the teacher might simply say to Max, &quot;Show me how you would multiply these two numbers.&quot; Max's demonstration may well provide important feedback for the teacher, and the teacher&#39;s appraisals and comments may contain feedback for Max. To the extent that the process enhances teaching and learning, it illustrates formative assessment.</p>
			<h3 class="h3">Observation</h3>
			<p class="txt">Informal observation and questioning present yet another source of information for formative assessment. Both teachers and students learn a great deal from observation. Simply observing learner behavior might reveal nonverbal indications of success and failure or of strengths and weakness. When students practice certain skills, for example, they might provide evidence of their progress&#8212;or lack thereof. And if teachers and learners use that evidence to improve student learning, it constitutes a kind of formative assessment. (See Table 5.2.)</p>

			<p class="txt">Among other things, good teachers, characterized by what Kounin (1970) labels <strong>with-it-ness</strong>, are acutely aware of what is going on in their classrooms. Teachers who are &quot;with it&quot; are far better classroom managers, Kounin informs us. They detect behaviors that are off task and potentially distracting, sometimes almost before they occur. Many teachers have developed subtle, nonintrusive ways of managing classrooms.</p>
			<p class="key-point">Teachers who are good classroom managers are often the most effective teachers.</p>

			<div id="ecbox5-2" >
			<div class="single-column">
				<p class="txt">The following list includes some of the many different verbal and nonverbal sources of useful formative assessment information of teachers.</p>
				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text">how students interact with one another in group situations</li>
					<li class="li_text">the speed and ease with which individual learners accomplish assigned tasks</li>
					<li class="li_text">facial expressions that reveal frustration, confusion, and puzzlement</li>

					<li class="li_text">writing, verbal, and social skills</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="txt">For learners, too, there are a wide range of verbal and nonverbal teacher signals that can serve useful formative functions in the learning process.</p>
				<p class="txt">Many teachers make extensive use of informal questioning to guide their observations. These allow them to gauge learners&#39; understanding and to uncover misconceptions and deficits. A simple question such as &quot;Why do you think so?&quot; can quickly uncover a flaw in logic&#8212;or a brilliant and unexpected flash of creativity.</p>
				<p class="txt">Information gathered from these informal approaches can be communicated to learners in ways that relate directly to their experiences. For example, say a teacher observes that Nolan keeps rubbing his neck and is easily distracted when typing at his computer. The teacher might also note that Nolan&#39;s posture is awkward and that, as a result, the dynamic load he places on certain of his muscles is causing him fatigue, pain, and distraction. This assessment allows the teacher to provide Nolan with gentle feedback directed toward helping him develop a better physical relationship with his keyboard. This is formative assessment in practice. See <em>Applications: Gathering Informal Data</em> for more examples.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Applications: Gathering Informal Data</h3>
        <p class="txt">Here are some examples of teachers collecting informal assessment data.</p>
		
        <ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text"><strong><em>Exit tickets:</em></strong> At the conclusion of a high school social studies lesson on events leading to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, a teacher hands out a sticky note to each student. Students are asked to jot down one thing that is crystal clear about the lesson. As they leave the room, they post their note on the classroom door. The teacher then collects the notes and reviews the comments made, looking to see how many have identified the point she tried to make. In the past she has used this technique to uncover areas of confusion (asking students what was most unclear about today&#39;s lesson) and build metacognition (asking what students did to stay focused).</li>
					<li class="li_text"><strong><em>Anecdotal records:</em></strong> At the end of the day, a fourth-grade teacher pulls up a spreadsheet for his class. On this spreadsheet, he has written daily notes about his students. His objective is to summarize what he remembers about the academic and behavioral performances of four students each day. At the end of the week, he&#39;ll have comments on every student. Today he begins with Olivia. He remembers that she struggled with problems involving adding unlike fractions, mistakenly adding the two numerators and the two denominators to yield the sum. Thus, &#8531; + &#188; became 2/7. When he tried to intervene, she seemed embarrassed and said she knew what she was doing. He makes a note reminding himself to work with her in a small group the next day.</li>
					<li class="li_text"><strong><em>Digital cameras:</em></strong> A middle school art teacher frequently circulates around the room, taking digital photos, as he has been doing all year. Teams of students are working on three-dimensional objets d&#39;art meant to represent their experiences in middle school. The teacher photographs a group that seems to be working independently rather than as a cohesive unit. The next day, as the groups begin to engage in their project, he pulls the team aside and shows them yesterday&#39;s photo. This leads into a discussion of how the group is functioning.</li>
					<li class="li_text"><strong><em>Clipboards:</em></strong> A third-grade teacher circulates through her class, holding a clipboard on which is a sheet with each student&#39;s name in the left-hand column. Across the top of the sheet is a list of the money amounts students are to be calculating as they complete the worksheet on making change. As she passes by each student&#39;s desk, the teacher notes whether the change is correct and marks the sheet accordingly.</li>
					<li class="li_text"><strong><em>White boards:</em></strong> A high school foreign language teacher needs to be sure his students have quick recall of vocabulary terms. For the last 5 minutes of class, he says a word in English, and his students write its Spanish equivalent on the whiteboards with a dry erase marker. They keep their work facedown until the teacher gives the command. Instantly, they flash their boards and the teacher scans the room, noting who has the correct answer and who might need more review.</li>

		<h2 class="h2">More Formal Approaches to Formative Assessment</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Formative assessment is occasionally somewhat more formal, going beyond simple observation and questioning. For example, teachers might use brief exams and/or <em>benchmark</em> quizzes during instruction. These can provide information that might be useful in appraising and improving learner progress. It might also suggest ways of modifying instructional approaches.</p>
			<p class="txt">Another approach to formative assessment might ask learners to review each other&#39;s work, perhaps editing and commenting on written work, correcting computations, and evaluating products. Identifying and understanding assessment criteria that might be used for these purposes can help students develop skills associated with self-assessment and can also increase their motivation (Weaver &#38; Esposto, 2012). The ability to monitor and assess one&#39;s own activities is a fundamental goal of schools that want to teach learners how to learn.</p>
			<p class="txt">Students can use sample test questions or old exams as a form of self-assessment. Their performance on these might then suggest to them how they should direct future efforts. And teachers can use such items to uncover learner strengths and weaknesses and make adjustments in their instructional approaches.</p>
			<p class="txt">Learners and teachers might use any of a wide variety of ways of keeping instructional objectives clearly in mind and of tracking learner progress and achievements relative to these targets. These approaches might include the use of portfolios, rubrics, demonstrations, and other evidence of progress (see Chapter 7 for a discussion of these approaches to assessment).</p>
			<p class="txt">On a broader scale, schools might also use <strong>curriculum mapping</strong> to describe instructional goals and assessments more clearly. Curriculum mapping is based on the view that the curriculum is a dynamic, changing thing. Curriculum mapping is a way of describing the key components of a curriculum, including content and assessments (Jacobs, 1997, 2006). Often, teachers use computer-based templates to enter details of their curriculum content and of their assessments. Information entered by different teachers and different schools can then be collated and integrated to reveal a comprehensive map of specific curriculum levels and subjects.</p>
			<p class="txt">Curriculum mapping is one of the many activities often undertaken by <em>professional learning communities (PLCs)</em>. These, as we saw earlier, are formal groups of educators, often including teachers, administrators, and parents, who meet regularly, share their expertise, and collaborate on educational matters, including setting standards, developing curricula, and designing or selecting assessments.</p>
			<p class="txt">These various approaches to formative assessment are summarized in Figure 5.3.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">In the Classroom: Early Literacy</h3>
		<p class="txt">There is a powerful relationship between language skills (speaking and listening) and literacy (reading and writing). Moreover, there is a strong connection between these communication skills and success in all manner of endeavors&#8212;academic, social, work related, interpersonal, and so on. Research underlines the fact that ELL students, who are a growing segment of the U.S. population, often enter school at a distinct disadvantage relative to learners whose first language is English (Gottfried, 2017).</p>
		<p class="txt">A wide variety of early literacy programs have been developed to assist teachers and learners, beginning at the preschool level (see, for example, U.S. Department of Education, 2018a). Many of these include both instructional materials and guidance as well as assessment resources and suggestions. Assessment programs are often formative as well as summative: They are meant to provide information that informs and guides instruction. One example is DIBELS, a computer-adaptive placement assessment program designed to evaluate and predict literacy skill development from kindergarten through sixth grade. It is widely used to identify and help ELL students who are at risk of developing poor reading skills and experiencing academic failure.</p>
		<p class="txt">Another example is the HighScope Foundation&#39;s (2018) early literacy program. Among other things, the program provides a preschool curriculum built around key indicators of progress in speaking, listening, reading, and writing. The curriculum itself consists of a series of activity cards with accompanying storybooks. The objectives of this curriculum are closely aligned with core standards for most states. In addition, the program includes a guide for assessment, termed the Early Literacy Skills Assessment (ELSA).</p>
		<p class="txt">The ELSA program takes the form of a storybook. The teacher reads this book to the child, stopping where indicated to ask predetermined questions. These questions are meant to assess the child&#39;s general comprehension and understanding of the principles of the alphabet and of the significance of printed letters, as well as to elicit ideas. They serve both to assess the child&#39;s progress and to foster it&#8212;a formative function. The assessment storybook can be used with any literacy program.</p>
		<p class="txt">A third example of an early literacy assessment program is the web-based Early Learning Quick Assessment (ELQA) tool (ELQA: Early Learning Quick Assessments, 2018). The ELQA is a software program specifically designed to provide information that differentiates among learners, identifying those who are at risk of not meeting certain benchmark standards with respect to language and numerical skills. More important, it is designed to provide teachers with information about how they can differentiate instructional approaches in ways that will be most effective for individual learners.</p>

        <p class="intro">Formative assessment is not always a deliberately planned event: Good teachers constantly assess learner progress and evaluate the effectiveness of their approaches in a wide variety of formal and informal ways. But certain approaches to teaching and grading lend themselves more readily than others to formative assessment.</p>

<a id="p198"></a>
	<div class="section-body">
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Among these is <strong>competency-based learning</strong> (one form of which is mastery learning), which requires that learners reach and demonstrate a certain level of competency. Competency-based learning typically implies <strong>standards-based grading</strong> (also referred to as <em>criterion-referenced grading</em>).</p>
			<p class="txt">Standards-based grading refers to assessment in which the learner&#39;s achievement is evaluated in terms of a preset standard (criterion) of knowledge and/or performance. Iamarino (2014) argues that standards-based grading leads to increased student engagement and a more thorough understanding of course material. In many ways, she claims, it presents an advantage over grading systems that are based on points or percentages rather than on whether the learner has reached a certain standard. (See Chapter 6 for more information on criterion-referenced testing.)</p>
			<p class="txt">Because systems such as Bloom&#39;s mastery learning require that all learners reach certain standards (<em>master</em> learning objectives), they lend themselves to standards-based assessment. These systems are based on the notion that all learners can succeed and master a unit of study, but some require more time than others. This involves sequential testing designed to determine the extent to which learners have mastered a carefully designed progression of skills and content. Mastery learning requires instructors to break up a learning sequence into small, sequential steps. They then develop tests to assess how well learners are progressing in their efforts to master each step in the sequence. Results on these tests are formative in that they serve to indicate strengths and weaknesses and suggest changes in approaches to teaching and learning.</p>
			<p class="txt"><em>Curriculum-based measurement</em> (CBM), which is discussed in the next chapter, is often used along with competency-based instructional approaches. It involves assessment directly related to the curriculum, typically using brief quizzes and questions designed to gauge the learner&#39;s progression&#8212;hence the development of competence. CBM measures are available mainly for reading and mathematics.</p>

		<h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How does formative assessment support learning progressions?</span></h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section-lead">
        <p class="intro">One highly promising approach to formative assessment is based on <em>learning progressions</em>. The expression refers to sequences in the development of the learner&#39;s ideas and cognitive processes&mdash;sequences that are similar to the sequential steps into which lessons and units are broken down in mastery learning.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section-body">
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Some subject, such science and mathematics, lend themselves more readily to identifying learning progressions than other subjects, such as literature. For example, part of a beginning learning progression in a mathematics lesson dealing with how to count might include skills that define three distinct, sequential steps: counting forward from a given number, counting either forward or backward, and skip counting (for example, by twos). Devising simple assessments to check for learner movement through this progression can quickly reveal whether instruction needs to be modified. Thus, an analysis of the learning progression becomes a form of formative assessment. Formative assessments based on learning progressions examine the learner&#39;s cognitive activities with a view to monitoring progression through a sequence of prerequisite cognitive skills and providing them with feedback designed to foster learning.</p>	

			<a id="p199"></a>		
			<p class="txt">Some of the research on learning progressions begins with a look at student misconceptions and at the use of that information to help students&#39; journey through the progression. For example, a common misconception in early grade science is that the sun cycles around the earth. After all, it gets up in the east, moves over toward the center around noon, and drops out of sight in the west. A related misconception is that the earth is really like a flat disk. Misconceptions of this kind can lead to a series of simple experiments and demonstrations, arranged sequentially in the form of a learning progression, to explore correct initial misconceptions.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">The Assessment Triangle</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Aligning instruction and assessment with learning progressions involves taking steps to ensure that teaching and assessment reflect the logical and necessary steps through which the learner is expected to progress. This alignment, suggests Lai, Kobrin, DiCerbo, and Holland (2017), can be greatly facilitated through the application of the National Research Council&#39;s (2001) <strong>assessment triangle</strong>&mdash;a concept based on the notion that in order to develop meaningful learning progressions and assessments, it is essential that teachers be cognizant of what it is that students know and how they learn.</p>			
			<p class="txt">The three points of the assessment triangle are <em>observation</em>, <em>interpretation</em>, and <em>cognition</em>.</p>			
			<p class="txt">The cognition point refers to what we know about how students learn in a given area. This is the type of knowledge that makes it possible to develop useful and appropriate learning progressions.</p>			
			<p class="txt">Observation refers to the various ways in which instructors can determine learners' knowledge and skills and can differentiate among individual learners. Observation might take the form of formal or informal tests, quizzes, and other assessments.</p>			
			<p class="txt">Interpretation refers to the process of making inferences based on observations. In the words of the National Research Council (2001) report, &quot;Improved methods of assessment require a design process that connects the three elements of the assessment triangle to ensure that the theory of cognition, the observations, and the interpretation process work together to support the intended inferences&quot; (p 9).</p>			
			<p class="txt">Many recent studies have described learning progressions for different ages in fields such as mathematics and science education. For example, Lai and associates (2017) developed a learning progression describing the sequence of knowledge and skills involved in learning about the measurement of area in grades 3 and 4.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<a id="p200"></a>
		<h2 class="h2">Limitations of Learning Progressions</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">There are a number of important considerations that teachers should keep in mind in their efforts to assess learning progressions and to use these assessments for formative purposes. It seems clear that learning progressions are not inevitable, fixed sequences that always develop in each learner exactly as described and expected. In mathematics, for example, there are often many different ways of arriving at a clear understanding and generating a correct response. While the first steps and the final, ideal outcome of a learning progression might be crystal clear, the middle steps can vary considerably (Confrey, Maloney, &#38; Gianopulos, 2017).</p>			
			<p class="txt">Learning progressions often depend on how the learner is taught, as well as on prior skills and knowledge. They might also depend on the learner&#39;s personality characteristics. For example, impulsive or highly creative individuals might discover conceptual shortcuts that lead them quickly to a learning outcome. Others, more deliberate and reflective, might systematically work their way through each step of the progression exactly as some researcher has described it.</p>			
			<p class="key-point">Actual learning often involves simultaneous change and growth in more than one area. Accordingly, thinking of progressions in learning as always involving a single pathway leading to an identifiable goal can be misleading. Despite these considerations, knowing and assessing learning progressions can often be a useful approach to formative assessment.</p>			
			<p class="txt">Implementing knowledge of learning progressions requires, first, that the teacher have a clear view of intended instructional objectives and be able to describe them in terms of &quot;big ideas&quot; and sequential tasks, skills, or understandings that lead to these ideas. Second, the teacher needs to develop items, questions, observations, or other types of assessments that will reveal student progress and uncover weaknesses and misconceptions. And finally, feedback from these assessments must be used to improve learning and instruction. The next important task, Alonzo (2017) explains, is for teachers to become more aware of how students learn, a topic covered in Chapter 3.</p>

		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="key-point">Physical distance in the digital world is irrelevant. What is relevant for formative assessment is that digital technology can circumvent the need for an instructor to take charge of assessment.</p>
			<p class="txt">Electronic learning is often designed to provide learners with immediate feedback based on ongoing assessments of their efforts. Moreover, an intelligent tutoring system can adjust its offerings based on learner characteristics and immediate learner responses. And it can do this on a one-to-one basis for each of the dozens or even thousands of its learners simultaneously. These actions define good formative assessment.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">Computer Exercises and Simulations</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">As a learning and teaching tool, digital technology offers much more than simply word processing, computing, and social networking. One of its most common uses is simply for drill and practice exercises. Computers are exceptionally good and highly effective at teaching learners skills and knowledge that require repetition&#8212;things such as computational skills, keyboarding, spelling, word-attack skills, and basic facts in any many fields.</p>
			<p class="txt">When well designed, these programs individualize instruction by interacting with one student at a time. And from a formative assessment point of view, they are highly sensitive to the student&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. Many reflect the most highly researched and effective principles of good teaching: simple, brief units of information; errorless responding; and immediate, formative feedback (McIlvane, Kledaras, Gerard, Wilde, &#38; Smelson, 2018; Svoboda, Jones, Van Vulpen, &#38; Harrington 2013).</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<a id="p202"></a>
		<h2 class="h2">Computer Simulations</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Digital technologies also offer the possibility of developing highly effective <strong>computer simulations</strong> for instructional purposes, most of which have immediate assessment and feedback built into them. They have been shown to be highly effective for teaching students a large variety of concepts and subjects, especially in what are referred to as the <strong>STEM disciplines</strong> (<strong><u>s</u></strong>cience, <strong><u>t</u></strong>echnology, <strong><u>e</u></strong>ngineering, and <strong><u>m</u></strong>athematics; Lindgren, Tscholl, Wang, &#38; Johnson, 2016).</p>
			<p class="txt">For example, computer simulation programs are available that mimic the circulatory system, a chemical laboratory, or the in-flight responses of a Boeing 737 or a space capsule. Simulations allow the learner to discover the results of specific responses without the risk and expense of actually performing them. When using a computer-controlled simulator, ongoing <em>formative</em> feedback allows the student pilot to modify responses as required and also permits the simulator to modify its requirements in order to optimize student progress. Thus, a student can learn that a particularly unlucky combination of aileron and rudder movements can cause a crash without actually destroying either a multimillion-dollar aircraft or herself. See <em>Applications: Classroom-Based Simulations</em> for other examples of school simulations.</p>

			<h3 class="h3">Applications: Classroom-Based Simulations</h3>
			<p class="txt">Imagine a ninth-grade biology class in which students have been told that today everyone is going to dissect a frog. Every student will be given an incredibly sharp scalpel and will be directed to remove various parts of the frog to explore and understand the animal&#39;s anatomy. Now imagine you are the first-year teacher who has been asked to conduct this lesson. Does the thought of a classroom of 14-year-olds with lethal scalpels, many of them overwhelmed with anxiety&#8212;some perhaps even hysterical&#8212;send shivers up your spine?</p>
			<p class="txt">Now imagine the same learning objectives but without the sharp knives and the anxiety. Computer simulations that allow students to experience what it is like to actually dissect a live frog are now widely available. Examples include Tactus Technologies (2018) at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.tactustech.com/vfrog">http://www.tactustech.com/vfrog</a> and Digital Frog International (2018) at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.digitalfrog.com/products/frog-dissection.html">http://www.digitalfrog.com/products/frog-dissection.html</a>.</p>
			<p class="txt">Computer simulations make possible learning experiences that would not otherwise be available. For example, one of the earliest educationally oriented simulations allowed children to travel along the famous Oregon Trail to the West Coast. This simulated field trip provides many of the same experiences as the actual trip might but none of the hardships and costs encountered by early settlers (History Globe, 2018; <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.historyglobe.com/websites.html">http://www.historyglobe.com/websites.html</a>).</p>

		<h2 class="h2">Virtual Reality Simulations</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Some simulations go beyond mimicking the functioning of the human body, the operation of an airplane&#39;s controls, or the dissection of a frog. Some can make you feel as though you were virtually in the airplane, and the ongoing feedback they provide becomes increasingly realistic and increasingly <em>formative</em> in enhancing learning. These are termed <strong>virtual reality simulations</strong>. Virtual reality systems are available for a variety of experiences, including field trips, language immersion experiences, the development of a large variety of motor and intellectual skills, and architectural designing.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="h2">Additional Software Tools</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">There are various other uses of digital technology for formative assessment. For example, programs such as Go Formative and Kahoot! provide novel, digital approaches to lesson presentations and formative assessment. Go Formative offers content-embedded online assessments and allows teachers to upload their own content in a wide variety of subjects or to use materials already available. It includes ongoing quick quizzes and checks for understanding. Kahoot! is a game-based system designed to present quizzes, surveys, and even discussions. Entire classes can play the game on their smartphones, tablets, or computers.</p>
			<p class="txt">Go Formative and Kahoot! are just two of many different programs designed to assist teachers with their instructional and formative assessment undertakings. In addition, certain features of widely used word processing software such as Microsoft Word can be used to provide learners with ongoing feedback relating to their written work, including spelling and grammatical corrections. The &quot;Review&quot; feature of Microsoft Word allows teachers and learners to &quot;track&quot; changes in written work and to make marginal comments. These comments can be directly evaluative: <em>Good point; Well- developed argument; Insufficient motivation for protagonist's actions.</em> Or they might be phrased as questions: <em>Why do you think so? Can you elaborate?</em></p>
			<p class="txt"><em>Do you think greed was her only motive?</em> For recurring comments, teachers can develop what are termed <em>auto-text shortcuts</em> that eliminate the need to keyboard each comment.</p>

			<a id="p204"></a>
			<p class="txt">One common application of formative assessment has traditionally required that teachers circulate among learners, observing their efforts, answering their questions, guiding, directing, questioning, and providing various kinds of assistance in light of the teacher&#39;s assessment of learner skills, knowledge, and needs. Now that learners in many classrooms work directly on computers, programs are available that eliminate the need for teachers to circulate among their charges, examining and evaluating what they find on each learner's screen. A variety of <em>screen-sharing</em> programs allow teachers to view each learner's screen on their own desktop monitors and even to make comments on each student's screen. An Internet search using the phrase &quot;screen sharing software&quot; will quickly locate a variety of programs for this purpose. Many of these are free software. Most school jurisdictions have information technology specialists who can easily set up a teacher&#39;s class to provide for screen sharing.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="section-lead">
        <p class="intro">Also highly relevant to formative assessment are the variety of computer-based instructional programs that are designed not as simulations or as simple drill and practice exercises; instead, they are intended to teach much like an intelligent teacher might in a one-on-one setting.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section-body">
		
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">These programs are often labeled <strong>intelligent tutor systems (ITS)</strong>, also referred to as <em>knowledge-based tutors</em>. In essence, they are examples of <strong>artificial intelligence (AI)</strong>.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">What Is AI?</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Basically, <em>artificial intelligence</em> refers to the properties of a computer, or computer-controlled, system that is capable of performing tasks that normally require intelligence (Copeland, 2018). For example, when they are carried out by a machine or other human-produced, computer-controlled device, activities such as hearing, seeing, recognizing speech, making decisions, and translating languages are considered manifestations of artificial intelligence. Thus, even a vacuum robot that goes around your house all by itself, avoiding obstacles, freeing itself from tight corners, and sucking up dirt illustrates important aspects of artificial intelligence. True, the vacuum robot is a mindless piece of plastic, metal, sensors, actuators, power units, and so on; it has no brain as we know it. But it does have computer elements, and it makes decisions.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<a id="p205"></a>
		<h2 class="h2">What Are Intelligent Tutor Systems?</h2>
<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Intelligent tutor systems are a form of AI. Essentially, they are programs that take into account the learner's strengths and weakness and that make decisions about the appropriateness of their offerings and change them accordingly, much the way a good teacher does. They perceive learner responses; they analyze them (think about them?); they make decisions. These are all activities we think of as requiring intelligence, artificial though it might be.</p>
			<p class="txt">Intelligent tutor systems that adjust their instructional offerings on the basis of their interpretation of learner characteristics resemble computer-adaptive tests (described in Chapter 3). Recall that these tests are designed to estimate the candidate&#39;s skill and competence level and to adjust the nature and sequence of test items accordingly.</p>

				<p class="cr">Ton Koene/age fotostock/SuperStock</p>
				<p class="caption">Intelligent tutor systems are computer-based instructional programs. The best of these adjust their instructional offerings in response to learner characteristics. But most computer-based tutor systems don&#39;t look at all like Honda&#39;s robot, ASIMO. (<em>ASIMO</em> stands for &quot;Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility.&quot;) Honda had offered to let ASIMO teach young children science but has now retired ASIMO to focus on smaller robots related to autonomous vehicles and to mobility aids. </p>
			</figcaption>
        </figure>

		<div class="single-column">

			<p class="txt">Intelligent tutor systems do much the same thing. They determine the learner's current knowledge and skills, and they adjust their instructional offerings accordingly. The cornerstones of such systems are the procedures they use to analyze the student&#8212;hence, their built-in assessment systems. Intelligent tutor systems try to determine what a student knows (or needs to know) based on the student's interactions with the system&#8212;that is, typically on the basis of the student's responses. Some systems attempt to determine important learner qualities, such as how confident learners feel about their effectiveness as learners and their estimates of how successful they expect to be in this learning task&#8212;a concept known as <strong>self-efficacy</strong> (Bandura, 2006; McQuiggan, Mott, &#38; Lester, 2008). The system then draws from its database the experiences and instructions that will be most effective for this student according to the goals programmed into it.</p>

				<h2 class="h2">Modules of Intelligent Tutor Systems</h2>
				
				<div class="single-column">
				<p class="txt">Intelligent tutor systems can be described in terms of five separate aspects or &quot;modules&quot;: expert, student, instructional, communication, and evaluation (Farnham-Diggory, 1992; Mohamed, Aljahdali, &#38; Idhris, 2013). The expert module is the source of knowledge&#8212;or in computer jargon, a database. Like a good teacher, the ITS database allows the program to select from its store of expert knowledge those items of information and activities that are appropriate for specific learners.</p>

				<a id="p206"></a>
				<p class="txt">The student module is the computer's representation of what the student is like. This representation is derived from the student's responses but must necessarily be based on certain preconceptions about learners that are built into the system. The system must also be designed so that it can obtain the information it needs to have about the learner. That is, just as a good tutor asks the learner to explain an answer, so too might an ITS&#8212;and it would then use this information to make qualitative judgments about the learner. For example, an ITS program developed by Xin and associates (2016) for teaching mathematics to students with learning difficulties continually assesses learner comprehension and performance and adjusts its instruction accordingly.</p>
				<p class="txt">The instructional module consists of pedagogical, or teaching, rules built into the system. The rules might take forms such as this: &quot;If a student qualified as X gives response (explanation) A, then . . .&quot; In a real sense, the intelligent tutor uses ongoing assessment much like a good teacher might use formative assessment as an integral part of instruction.</p>
				<p class="txt">The communication component of an ITS consists of the interface, or link, between student and machine. It includes the ways that the learner interacts with the system (voice commands, a keyboard, a mouse, a joystick, a finger) and the ways that the system interacts with the learner (visual display, auditory signals).</p>
				<p class="txt">Finally, the evaluation module allows the system to assess the learner&#39;s performance and adjust instructional offerings on that basis. These five modules are summarized in Table 5.3.</p>

		<h2 class="h2">Top-Down Versus Bottom-Up Programming</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Intelligent tutor systems are a form of <em>adaptive learning software</em>, as are computer-adaptive tests. However, both of these approaches in education, Nasserghodsi (2017) explains, require what is referred to as <em>top-down</em> programming, meaning programmers must foresee all the decisions that the program will need to make. They must try to anticipate all possible learner responses. And they are the ones, not the machine, who decide what the machine response will be. Whether that is truly artificial intelligence is up for debate, claims Nasserghodsi.</p>

			<a id="p207"></a>
			<p class="key-point">What is not so much up for debate, however, is the possibility that <em>bottom-up</em> programming of artificially intelligent machines may soon revolutionize their impact in education.</p>
			<p class="txt">Bottom-up programming tries to simulate the complex actions of networks of neurons (that&#39;s what the human brain is) with the goal of producing a program that mimics the human brain, perhaps solving problems in different ways, arriving at novel solutions, or making unexpected decisions.</p>
			<p class="txt">The well-known program Google Translate illustrates bottom-up programming. Instead of being programmed with word and phrase equivalents for the more than 100 languages it can translate, it uses a neural network model that allows it to look at entire sentences at a time and compare them with phrases in millions of documents in an effort to arrive at the best translation. It can then arrange this translation according to grammatical rules and speak the language very much as a human might. What Google Translate says, when it speaks the words &quot;I am artificially intelligent,&quot; in Chinese is not a phrase that has been specifically programmed into it. It is a phrase that it has itself discovered.</p>
			<p class="txt">Advances in AI, suggests Nasserghodsi (2017), may produce learning programs that respond to student emotions and not simply to the content of their responses. It may also lead to different ways of providing differentiated instruction, taking into account the needs of each individual student with respect to enrichment or remediation. AI systems might also provide immediate, continually updated content that does not depend on the human input of revisions in textbooks or in computer-based educational material.</p>

		<h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How effective is the use of digital technology in education?</span></h2>
	</div>
	<div class="section-lead">
        <p class="intro">Computers and related technology have enormous advantages for certain purposes in schools.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="section-body">
		
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Among these advantages are the staggering memory capacities of modern computers, the overwhelming rapidity and accuracy with which they can deliver information, their problem-solving and computation capabilities, and the versatility of their presentation modes.</p>
			<p class="txt">Computers also present advantages that are not directly related to their role in assisting instruction but instead are related to the cognitive processes their use can foster. As Papert (1993) notes, computers are intellectual tools that require a degree of explicitness and precision in the use of language&#8212;and therefore in thinking&#8212;not found in ordinary conversation.</p>
			<p class="key-point">Yet how well do computers teach? Not surprisingly, the research says, &quot;Quite well, thank you.&quot;</p>
			<p class="txt">In fact, most of the many forms of computer-assisted or computer-based instruction lead to some positive changes in learners. The important question is whether they teach better than human teachers. Computers can do things that are different from what teachers do, and they can do them in a different way as well.</p>
			<p class="key-point">But computers cannot replace teachers at all; they are simply another resource, another tool in the teacher's kit.</p>
		</div>
		
		<a id="p208"></a>
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">Effectiveness of Computer Exercises</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Investigations of the effectiveness of computer-based drill and practice programs have typically supported the belief that these can be highly effective in promoting learning of basic mathematical skills, motor skills such as keyboarding, second-language skills, and reading skills. For example, Williams (2004) compared a group of advanced seventh-grade students who had spent 7 weeks working through a math skills drill program with a comparable group of students who had done similar drills using paper and pencil. The multiplication skills of the computer-taught group improved significantly during the program; those of the group using paper and pencil did not.</p>
		</div>
		</div>
		
		<h2 class="h2">Effectiveness of Simulations</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Investigations of simulation programs, too, have often found very positive results. For example, Plass and associates (2012) report a study in which 718 high school students in 25 different classrooms were exposed to either a textbook-based chemistry program or an experimental, computer-based simulation program. In this study, students in the simulation program outperformed those in the more conventional program. That may be partly because well-designed simulations give students a variety of ways of exploring concepts. Also, they require active participation by learners, and they encourage creative thinking, problem solving, and enquiry. In addition, they often increase motivation by embedding elements of game playing with the instruction.</p>	
		</div>
		
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">Effectiveness of ITS</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
			<p class="txt">Much of the research on the effectiveness of intelligent tutoring systems is also positive when these systems are compared with more traditional classroom approaches (e.g., Kulik &#38; Fletcher, 2016; Steif, Fu, &#38; Kara, 2016). By definition, these systems are based on continuous formative assessment. Formative assessment ensures that the system will be intelligently responsive to individual differences among learners. This can sometimes go a long way toward ensuring that learners achieve at their full potential. Interestingly, however, when intelligent tutoring systems are compared with competent human tutors&#8212;good teachers interacting with the learner in a one-on-one basis&#8212;the ITS programs no longer present a significant advantage (Kulik &#38; Fletcher, 2016; VanLehn, 2011).</p>	
			<p class="key-point">Keep in mind, however, that the use of expensive and highly sophisticated technologies does not automatically imply faster and better learning, greater motivation, and higher levels of happiness among teachers and students.</p>	

			<a id="p209"></a>
			<p class="txt">In fact, computers and related technologies are now so common that their novelty has quite disappeared. Most students are no longer deliriously excited at the prospect of a course or a lesson delivered to them via digital technology. The novelty of the medium no longer carries the day. Now the presentation itself has to rival that of an expert teacher in terms of structure, interest, delivery, warmth, and all the other positive things that good teachers bring with them.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How is diagnostic assessment used?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">Simply defined, diagnostic assessment probes into learning problems and deficits.</p>
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Because it is often a preinstruction form of assessment, it is generally considered a part of placement assessment. However, whereas placement assessment is used mainly to select and place learners in certain programs or courses of study, diagnostic assessment is designed mainly to identify learner strengths and weakness.</p>

    <p class="key-point">Unlike formative assessment, which typically provides feedback and information during instruction, diagnostic assessment most often looks at strengths and weaknesses before instruction.</p>

	<p class="txt">It is important to recognize, however, that the main purpose of both diagnostic and formative assessment is to assist and improve student learning.</p>
	</div>
   <div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Identifying and Correcting Issues</h2>



	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">In diagnostic assessment, the teacher asks two kinds of questions. The first kind, intended to identify the issue, might take these forms: Why have my instructional objectives not been met? Why does Slavik struggle in arithmetic? Why does Addy not seem to understand what she reads? And the second kind, which aims to correct the issue, asks questions like these: What can I do to help Slavik and Addy? What can Slavik and Addy do to help themselves?</p>

      </figure>    
	   
	</div>
	
	 <h2 class="h2">Differentiating Among Learners</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Some applications of diagnostic assessment are often referred to as <strong>differentiated assessment</strong>. Differentiated assessment is designed to identify learners with different characteristics and therefore with different needs. In other words, it attempts to differentiate among learners.</p>

	<a id="p211"></a>
	<p class="txt">For example, the teacher who asks &quot;Why are some of my students having trouble reading?&quot; might use various formal and informal diagnostic assessments to look at a range of possibilities, including lack of interest, sensory problems, lack of practice in reading, low general intelligence, physical illness, and emotional problems. These approaches to diagnosis are examples of differentiated assessments: They provide a basis for differentiating among learners, suggesting, for example, that Omar has difficulty seeing&#8212;a problem that might be easily corrected with eye glasses&#8212;and that ELLs like Elisha have different language-related reading problems that require specific interventions. In much the same way as diagnostic assessments in education can yield important information about differences among learners, they can also suggest highly effective ways in which instruction should be differentiated (termed <strong>differentiated instruction</strong>).</p>

	<p class="txt">Differentiated assessment is especially important for ELL students such as Elisha as well as for learners from ethnic minorities and those who are economically disadvantaged. For these children, differentiated instruction can be enormously effective (Tomlinson &#38; Jarvis, 2014). Unfortunately, as Tomlinson (2014) points out, those in need of differentiated instruction are not always identified; and among those who are identified, many of the gifted or challenged spend most of their school time in regular classrooms.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the principal approaches to diagnostic assessment? What is the Response to Intervention model?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">If the question that needs to be answered by a diagnostic assessment is a general one&#8212;such as, Why have my instructional objectives not been met?&#8212;diagnosis will likely involve the entire class.</p>
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Approaches to diagnosis might consider the adequacy of instructional strategies. They might also look at learner characteristics such as motivation, readiness in terms of previous learning, and presence of prerequisite skills and knowledge.</p>

    <p class="txt">Relevant information might be gathered through a combination of informal approaches, such as observing student behavior and asking questions. Or information gathering might involve more structured, formal approaches, including teacher-made tests and quizzes or even standardized achievement or ability tests (we discuss these topics in Chapter 10).</p>

	<p class="txt">If the question in need of answers has to do with an individual student rather than with the entire class, the diagnostic assessment will be limited to that student. Again, relevant information might be gathered through informal approaches such as questioning the student or closely monitoring the student&#39;s work to detect areas of weakness&#8212;and perhaps of strength as well. Alternatively, more formal testing procedures might be used.</p>
	</div>
	
	<a id="p212"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	 <h2 class="h2">The Diagnostic Interview</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Initial conversations between clinicians and their patients often take the form of a <strong>diagnostic interview</strong>. This is an interview in which the clinician attempts to arrive at a preliminary diagnosis. In both a clinical setting and a school setting, a diagnostic interview will often use a formal assessment instrument such as the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Some sections of this diagnostic tool have also been developed for children, such as the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children (DISC), and are frequently used in schools (Shaffer, Fisher, Lucas, Dulcan, &#38; Schwab-Stone, 2000).</p>

	<p class="txt">The DISC is a structured interview, with all questions clearly specified and sequenced. The instrument is available for computer-assisted administration and can be presented by untrained interviewers as well as by clinical professionals. It has proved useful in diagnosing children with some 34 different mental and emotional disorders, including attention disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (e.g., Rolon-Arroyo, Arnold, Harvey, &#38; Marshall, 2016).</p>

	<p class="txt">Another diagnostic interview procedure has also been developed by Ginsburg, Pappas, Lee, and Chiong (2011) to uncover learning problems in mathematics. The authors created a flowchart that describes different learning progressions for given topics in a mathematics program. They then generated a sequence of questions matched to this progression. Questions vary on age and grade level.</p>

	<p class="txt">Vastly simplified, the diagnostic interview typically begins by asking a question like this: How much is 4 plus 7? The student is given a choice of simply responding directly or of using paper and pencil, fingers, or tokens to help answer the question. Depending on the nature of the response and on the strategy used, the interviewer then taps one of several icons on a handheld device. For example, if the student says &quot;11,&quot; the examiner taps the green icon indicating a correct response, and she also taps an icon that represents the strategy used (tokens, counting out loud, paper and pencil, mental solution). If the response is incorrect, the examiner taps a red icon.</p>

	<p class="txt">If the answer is correct, the program then prompts the examiner to ask, first, How did you know that? and second, Is there another way you could have found the answer? If the answer is incorrect, the program presents a different series of questions. In either case, the objective is to uncover the cognitive processes at play and to assess their effectiveness and appropriateness. The ultimate goal is to diagnose learning problems and remedy them.</p>

	<p class="txt">The Ginsburg et al. (2011) diagnostic interview is an example that illustrates the analysis and use of a learning progression for assessment. It requires analysis of the sequence of skills and knowledge that underlie successful performance in a given area. And it suggests ways of altering the teaching and learning process to facilitate learner progress.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<a id="p213"></a>
	<h2 class="h2">Concept Maps</h2>
	<div class="single-column">

	<p class="txt">An approach related to diagnostic assessment looks at the structure of the learner&#39;s concepts. This requires developing a <strong>concept map</strong> or <em>concept model</em>. A concept map is usually a graphic representation, although it can also be verbal. It typically shows relationships among ideas or major concepts. Developing a concept map with a learner may reveal certain weaknesses. For example, the concept map might show that some important concepts are missing or that the learner has failed to make connections that are essential for further understanding.</p>

	<p class="txt">As an example of a simple concept map, Figure 5.5 shows a hypothetical student&#39;s understanding of how bat echolocation works. It is a relatively impressive concept map with advanced and well-linked concepts. However, questioning the student about this concept map might reveal to a clever teacher that there are certain gaps in the student&#39;s knowledge and understanding. Missing concepts, and the understandings they would lead to, might include the following.</p>

		<ol class="nl">
		<li class="li_text"><em>Concept</em>: The sound wave emitted by the bat is in the range of 100,000 Hz. <em>Understanding</em>: We humans cannot hear bats.</li>
		<li class="li_text"><em>Concept</em>: A silent dog whistle emits vibrations slightly in excess of 20,000 Hz. <em>Understanding</em>: Dogs cannot hear bats either.</li>
		<li class="li_text"><em>Concept</em>: The bat&#39;s tiny brain is like a computer that allows it to calculate&#8212;based on its knowing that sound travels at the speed of 343.2 meters per second in dry air at 20&#176;C&#8212;exactly how far away the spider is. This remarkable bat computer can adjust for different temperature and humidity conditions. <em>Understanding</em>: Even if we had exactly the same information as the bat does regarding speed of transmission, we would have little idea how far away the spider is unless we plugged all relevant information, together with appropriate formulas, into one of our computers.</li>
		<li class="li_text"><em>Concept</em>: Returning sound waves strike the bat&#39;s two ears at slightly different times. <em>Understanding</em>: The bat not only can calculate how far away the spider is but also knows in precisely what direction.</li>
		<li class="li_text"><em>Concepts</em>: Perhaps the most basic inappropriate and missing concepts in this learner&#39;s concept map are that spiders do not fly and that bats do not hunt on the ground. <em>Understanding</em>: The bat will not locate nor catch nor eat the spider.</li>

	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">Concept maps are not used just for diagnosis; they can also be used for instructional purposes. For example, a concept map developed by the instructor can be valuable in focusing the learner&#39;s attention. Concept maps highlight the most important ideas and the relationships among them, and they also provide the learner with a visual representation of these connections and associations. Visual representations are often much clearer than descriptions and explanations that are purely verbal. And studies of memory make it clear that visual representations are often more memorable as well&#8212;a phenomenon labeled the <em>picture superiority effect</em> (e.g., Guez &#38; Lev, 2016; Hung, Edmonds, &#38; Reilly, 2016).</p>
	
     <p class="txt">As instructional tools, concept maps can be effective in developing learner skills related to</p>

	 <ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">drawing inferences from observations,</li>
          <li class="li_text">analyzing and integrating information and ideas, and</li>
          <li class="li_text">acquiring concepts and understanding theories (Acharya &#38; Sinha, 2017; Novak, 2009).</li>
      </ul>

	<a id="p215"></a>
	 <p class="txt">One way of using concept maps for instruction&#8212;as well as formative assessment&#8212;is for the instructor to develop a partial map. It might contain some or most of the big ideas, but with a number of key concepts or relationships missing. The learner is later asked to complete the map. This exercise allows the instructor to assess student understanding. Learner responses to this task can then serve as a basis for further instruction or guided learning activities (e.g., Atapattu, Falkner, &#38; Falkner, 2017). Various programs are available for developing concept maps, including CmapTools, MindMeister, Draw.io, and Moodle.</p>

	<div class="inner-section">
	 <h2 class="h2">Cognitive Diagnostic Assessment</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Approaches such as concept maps and clinical interviews are examples of what Leighton and Gierl (2007) label <strong>cognitive diagnostic assessment</strong>. The expression refers specifically to assessment designed to yield information about the student&#39;s cognitive skills with a view to identifying strengths and weakness. The ultimate goal of cognitive diagnostic assessment is not simply to evaluate cognitive skills; rather, it is part of a larger process designed to identify and remediate learning problems (Yi, 2017; Leighton &#38; Chu, 2016).</p>

	<p class="txt">The most useful approaches to cognitive diagnostic assessment, suggest Gierl, Leighton, and Hunka (2007), are those that base the assessment on information we have about cognitive functioning. Especially relevant in this regard are models such as Bloom&#39;s revised hierarchy of intellectual skills and Gagn&#233;&#39;s learning outcomes (discussed in Chapter 4).</p>

	<p class="txt">What Gierl and colleagues (2007; Cui, Gierl, &#38; Guo, 2016) propose is the development of structured tests in which responses can be classified in terms of a hierarchical list of sequential cognitive strategies and skills. For example, tests questions might be aligned to Bloom&#39;s revised taxonomy (see Chapter 4) to reveal whether learners are operating at the most basic levels (simply <em>remembering</em> but failing to <em>understand</em> or <em>apply</em>), or whether they have progressed to higher level strategies and skills (<em>analyzing</em> and <em>evaluating</em>, for example). In many ways this is similar to the use of learning progressions for formative and diagnostic assessment.</p>

	<p class="txt">Computer-adaptive testing also presents exciting possibilities for cognitive diagnosis. A computer-adaptive test is designed to present each candidate with a different number and sequence of items reflecting the computer&#39;s estimate of the candidate&#39;s abilities. Because the main goal of cognitive diagnosis is to determine individual strengths and weaknesses in cognitive strategies and skills, a computer-based test that responds to individual differences is especially useful (McGlohen &#38; Chang, 2008).</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Standardized Tests for Diagnosis</h2>
	<div class="single-column">

	<p class="txt">Another structured and formal approach to diagnostic assessment of individuals involves the use of standardized tests. For example, if the teacher thinks the learner might have a <strong>specific learning disability</strong>, a standardized test designed to identify learning disabilities might be used. A specific learning disability (often referred to simply as a <em>learning disability</em>) is marked by learning difficulties in one or more areas, when the learning difficulties are not related to general intellectual disability or to emotional problems. Learning disabilities are most often evident in areas such as reading and arithmetic.</p>

	<a id="p216"></a>
	<p class="txt">Learners with specific learning disabilities characteristically manifest a consistently uneven pattern of achievement, often doing very poorly in one area but not in others. For example, although their measured abilities might be normal or even above normal, they might struggle hopelessly in arithmetic or in reading. And although an uneven pattern of achievement is typical for these children, those who have a severe reading disability&#8212;labeled a <strong>developmental reading disorder</strong> or sometimes <strong>dyslexia&#8212;</strong>might, as a result, do badly in other subjects in which reading is important.</p>

	<p class="txt">Figure 5.6 summarizes these various approaches to diagnostic assessment.</p>

As shown here, <em>diagnostic</em> and <em>formative</em> assessment overlap both in terms of approaches used and in terms of their ultimate objective: to improve the teaching&#8211;learning process and its outcomes.

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Response to Intervention</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Another approach, labeled <strong>Response to Intervention (RTI)</strong>, is both a method of diagnostic assessment and an instructional/remediation system. As such, it is a clear and structured approach to formative assessment. A relatively recent initiative, RTI may well represent a major change in U.S. educational systems and especially in the way that schools identify and deal with those in need of special educational services.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Assumptions of the RTI Model</h3>
	<p class="txt">RTI arose largely as a replacement for assessments that identify students in need of special intervention on the basis of measured low ability. The main idea of the RTI model is that learners who do not benefit from instruction that is otherwise effective are more likely than others to require special education (Special Education Guide, 2018).</p>

	<p class="txt">The RTI model is based on several assumptions. Among them are these beliefs:</p>
	
	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">All children can benefit from educational intervention.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Early intervention is critical to prevent later problems.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Educators need to monitor the learner&#39;s progress carefully during intervention.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Assessments of rate and level of learning should be formative&#8212;these assessments should be used as a basis for ongoing educational decisions and for attempts to improve teaching and learning.</li>
      </ul>

	<h3 class="h3">RTI Tiered Interventions</h3>
	<p class="txt">The RTI model is designed to provide a series&#8212;referred to as <em>tiers</em>&#8212;of specially designed, highly researched interventions for learners identified as being at risk for poor performance. Once these learners have been identified, usually in the early grades or even in kindergarten, they are exposed to Tier 1 interventions. These interventions involve high-quality instruction in the basic curriculum, but with systematic and frequent monitoring of student progress. Educators using this model look at the student&#39;s learning rate and level of performance following high-quality instruction. In other words, they look at the learner&#39;s response to intervention (hence the label).</p>

	<p class="txt">A basic assumption underlying RTI is that most students benefit significantly from intense, well-designed instruction. Between 80&#37; and 85&#37; of all students are expected to require no intervention beyond Tier 1.</p>

	<p class="txt">In the RTI model, tiered interventions become increasingly intense. Thus, Tier 2 interventions usually involve highly focused instruction in small groups. And the 2&#37; to 3&#37; of students who continue to experience difficulties (measured in terms of level and speed of learning) following Tier 2 intervention will then move to Tier 3. Although Tier 3 intervention continues to occur in the regular classroom, it typically involves one-on-one interaction.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">Throughout the three intervention tiers, there is a continuous sequence of assessments in the form of progress monitoring. This assessment is designed to determine whether a given learner is benefiting from intervention. Measured response to intervention is then used as a basis for educational decisions concerning both instructional strategies and curriculum. Thus, RTI assessment clearly has both diagnostic and formative purposes (see Figure 5.7).</p>

          <p class="caption">The RTI approach is based on the assumption that early intervention with research-tested instruction can be effective for most learners.

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Failure to benefit from RTI interventions may lead to important educational decisions concerning the intensity and duration of further interventions or perhaps even the need for special educational services. By the same token, especially positive learner outcomes following interventions might be a basis for removing the learner from further interventions or special services (National Association of State Directors of Special Education, 2008).</p>
	
	<p class="txt">A good source of information about implementing RTI, and a guide to some of the many resources freely available, is Intervention Central (2018).</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Uses and Implementation of RTI</h3>
	<p class="txt">Not surprisingly, implementation of the RTI model may be useful not only for the early identification of learners with problems but also as a means of preventing problems. RTI requires school systems to implement carefully thought-out, comprehensive, and highly coordinated instructional and assessment systems. These systems make a heavy demand on school personnel but at the same time have tremendous potential for improving the teaching&#8211;learning process and preventing learning problems that might otherwise arise.</p>
	
	<a id="p219"></a>
	<p class="txt">Another important contribution of the RTI model has to do with the enormous amount of research it has generated. For example, the educational database PsycINFO, which compiles work related to psychology and education, lists over 350 research articles relating to the search phrase &quot;Response to Intervention&quot; during the past 2 years alone. These articles reflect a growing interest in analyzing the skills and strategies involved in learning, developing assessments to monitor progress in the development of these intellectual skills, and working out some of the practical considerations involved in implementing RTI. Dozens of important issues and questions have been examined, including the following:</p>
	
	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">professional confusion relating to the legal aspects of applying RTI and the implications thereof RTI (Zirkel, 2018)</li>
          <li class="li_text">the use of RTI to identify students with specific learning disabilities (Maki, 2018)</li>
          <li class="li_text">the effectiveness of RTI approaches for improving English language proficiency among ELL students (Arrimada, Torrance, &#38; Fidalgo, 2018)</li>
          <li class="li_text">differences in individual responses to intervention (Kelley, Leary, &#38; Goldstein, 2018)</li>
      </ul>

	<p class="txt">Although RTI was almost unknown at the turn of the 21st century, a large number of states have now either fully or partially implemented it (Center on Response to Intervention, 2018). Not all jurisdictions that adopt RTI do so across all subject areas. Implementing RTI across entire school systems can be a difficult, expensive, and time-consuming undertaking. This may be why, as VanDerHeyden (2018) notes, many school psychologists (and teachers and administrators) continue to use ineffective practices in spite of mounting evidence that other approaches might be preferable.</p>

	<p class="txt">In the end, the RTI model may represent something of a revolution in teaching and assessment. Or not. History will let us know later.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">All educational assessment, whether it be explicitly formative or better described as placement, diagnostic, or summative, has a formative function in the sense that all good assessment is directed toward improving teaching and learning.</p>
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">
  <div class="single-column">
      
    <p class="txt">But, unlike other forms of assessment that also have clearly identifiable purposes implicit in the labels <em>diagnosis</em>, <em>placement</em>, and <em>summation</em>, the sole purpose of formative assessment is to assist the teaching&#8211;learning processes during instruction. How important and effective is formative assessment?</p>

	 <p class="txt">The classic piece of research on its effectiveness is Black and Wiliam&#39;s (1998) review of earlier studies. Recall that they define formative assessment as including all teacher or student activities that provide information that can then be used to modify teaching and learning. In this text, the meaning of formative assessment is limited to activities undertaken during instruction.</p>

          <p class="caption">Formative assessment need not involve only teachers and learners. Students, too, can be a valuable source of ongoing feedback.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

 <div class="single-column">
   <p class="txt">Those looking for research evidence that formative assessment actually improves learning often cite the Black and Wiliam (1998) article. In fact, however, this article does not describe new research but is instead a review of some 250 other articles. Many of these involved actual research, but some did not. After reviewing these articles, Black and Wiliam concluded that formative assessment improves performance on standardized achievement tests by a factor of 0.4 to 0.7&#8212;an astonishingly impressive result. However, caution Dunn and Mulvenon (2009), this conclusion is based mainly on a single summary of a large number of studies conducted by Fuchs and Fuchs (1986). The problem with this summary, explain Dunn and Mulvenon, is that 83&#37; of the nearly 4,000 participants involved were members of what were then called &quot;special education&quot; classes and were described as handicapped. In addition, only a few of the studies analyzed by Fuchs and Fuchs could be described as high-quality research.</p>
   
   <p class="txt">Since Black and Wiliam (1998) published their classic article on formative assessment, a wide variety of studies have looked at its effectiveness in terms of actual learning gains in specific areas as well as changes in motivation. For example, Maier, Wolf, and Randler (2016) conducted a study involving 10 secondary classrooms (261 study participants), in which one group of learners was provided with detailed, instruction-based feedback; a second group received simple, <em>dichotomous</em> feedback (right or wrong); and a third group received no ongoing feedback. In this study, learners who received either detailed or dichotomous feedback performed significantly better than those who received no feedback.</p>

      <div id="ecbox5-4">
        <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">A study by Bhagat, Liou, Spector, and Chang (2018) looked at a group of 35 fourth-grade students who used a program presented on iPads as a source of formative feedback during a unit on butterflies. Another 35 learners were exposed to the same material but without the iPad presentation and the formative assessment. Their findings showed significantly higher achievement and motivation among the children in the formative assessment group.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Similarly, Tuttle and Tuttle (2012) describe how formative assessment can be highly effective in teaching a second language&#8212;which should not be a particularly surprising observation. After all, very few approaches to second-language teaching don&#39;t involve continuous feedback. When the teacher says, &quot;No, you have to roll that <em>r</em> on the front of your tongue; look at my tongue, see?,&quot; formative assessment is clearly being used.</p>

        <a id="p221"></a>
		<p class="txt">The effectiveness of formative assessment is also evident in a large-scale study conducted by Bokhove and Drijvers (2012). They examined how formative assessment feedback in fifteen 12th-grade classrooms (9 different schools, 324 students) affected outcomes on summative assessments in algebra. The formative assessments used in these schools included feedback from pretests and a series of self-tests that learners took during their lessons. The self-tests were in the form of what the authors label <em>digital practice tools</em> and <em>digital diagnostic tests</em>. These tests analyzed each of the student&#39;s steps in solving algebraic problems and provided immediate feedback. The authors report significant gains in algebraic expertise as a result of these formative assessments. In their words, &quot;A large improvement is apparent in all four categories of tasks&quot; (Bokhove &#38; Drijvers, 2012, p. 203).</p>

		<p class="txt">Other research shows that formative assessment feedback can be highly effective in mathematics (Attali, 2015), in discovery-oriented science lessons (Fisher &#38; Frey, 2011), and in many other subject areas.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Finally, an often overlooked benefit of systematic formative assessment is that it can make learners more aware of their own cognitive processes&#8212;it can lead to metacognitive growth. The end result might be, as Black and Wiliam (2009) note, the development of more autonomous, self-regulated learners&#8212;of learners who have truly learned how to learn.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Themes</h2>
    <div class="single-column">
      <h3 class="h3"> Placement Assessment</h3>
      <p class="txt">Placement assessment is preinstruction assessment used to make decisions about the placement and selection of learners. Standardized placement instruments include the DIBELS system, designed for assessing early literacy skills as well as math skills, and a large variety of other standardized tests helpful for making career decisions and for selecting students for admission to postsecondary institutions (e.g., the SAT tests; HSPT tests).</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Formative Assessment</h3>
      <p class="txt">Formative assessment occurs during instruction and forms an integral part of the teaching&#8211; learning process. Its primary function is to provide feedback to improve teaching and foster learning. It is often called <em>assessment for learning</em> (rather than <em>of</em> learning) or <em>checking for understanding</em>. The key element of formative instruction is <em>feedback</em>&#8212;information about the effects of an action&#8212;that is used to inform instruction and enhance learning. Prompts can be used in a variety of ways as formative assessment feedback.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Implementing Formative Assessment</h3>
      <p class="txt">Implementing formative assessment requires (a) developing and communicating clear instructional objectives, (b) making decisions about the tools and approaches that might be used to assess progress toward these objectives, and (c) using information based on feedback from assessments to inform instruction and enhance student learning. Approaches to formative assessment are often highly informal and are typically embedded in sound approaches to instruction. They include the use of dialogue, demonstrations, and observations. More formal approaches might use quizzes, tests, mastery learning approaches, digital technology such as artificially intelligent tutor systems, curriculum mapping (often using collaborative PLCs), learning progressions, and a variety of computer-based instructional programs that embed formative assessments in instructional sequences.</p>


     <h3 class="h3">Diagnostic Assessment</h3>
	 <p class="txt">Diagnostic assessment has two basic purposes: to find out what is wrong and to determine how it might be corrected. This type of assessment is especially useful in conducting <em>differentiated assessments</em>&#8212;assessments designed to identify and differentiate among learner characteristics with a view to providing <em>differentiated instruction</em>&#8212;instruction that provides deliberate accommodations for learner differences. Diagnostic interviews, concept maps, cognitive diagnostic assessment, Response to Intervention (RTI), and a variety of standardized tests may be used as diagnostic assessment tools. Teachers using the RTI model look at how learners respond to interventions and base instructional approaches squarely on those responses.</p>

	 <h3 class="h3">Research on the Effectiveness of Formative Assessment</h3>
	 <p class="txt">There is widespread agreement that, on average, formative assessment produces profoundly positive results. Not only is it positively related to increased learner motivation, it is linked with significant improvements in learner performance as measured with standardized achievement tests.</p>
