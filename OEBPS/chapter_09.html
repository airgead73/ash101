    <p class="txt">The point made by Twain is still relevant. Even in today&#39;s schools, there are lies, damned lies, and sadly, abused statistics. Those who insist that numbers don&#39;t lie have not always looked very closely at the numbers in question.</p>

    <p class="txt">Reassuringly, statistics do not invariably lie. When a scientist measures the effects of heat on the evaporation of a liquid, she can accurately report that after x hours at temperature y, 18&#37; of the original liquid has evaporated and only 82&#37; remains. There is no lie in this statistic.</p>

    <p class="txt">Educational measurement is not quite so certain. Take, for example, the common practice of reporting student grades as a number intended to represent the student&#39;s average performance&#8212;say, for example, Alisha&#39;s final grade of 82&#37; in her English class. What, exactly, does 82&#37; mean? Does it mean Alisha failed to learn 18&#37; of her grade&#39;s English curriculum content&#8212;or that 18&#37; of the content has simply evaporated but that she knows the remaining 82&#37; of it?</p>
    <p class="txt">No, it means neither of these. In fact, Alisha&#39;s 82&#37; is open to many different interpretations. We know that what we measure in education is not like temperature or height or weight&#8212;or even evaporation. Typically, we measure qualities rather than quantities, and strictly speaking, the measurement of qualities does not lend itself easily to the meaningful and accurate use of averages. For example, when assessing Alisha&#39;s grasp of the English curriculum, we might ask difficult questions such as: How persuasively does Alisha express her convictions? How sophisticated is her use of language? How appropriate are her interpretations? And the tasks we present Alisha in our efforts to answer these questions are often vague and inexact. Even though answers to the questions we pose yield numbers that allow us to calculate averages like 82&#37;, the meaning of these numbers is often unclear.</p>

		<h2 class="h2">What Is or Are Statistics?</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
		<p class="txt"><strong>Statistics</strong> can be defined as the science that deals with numerical data. However, the word <em>statistic</em> refers to a single numerical fact or <strong>datum</strong> (singular of <em>data</em>). Thus, the word <em>statistics</em>, as the plural of <em>statistic,</em> denotes a collection of numerical facts (data). For example, the statistics that make up a student&#39;s final grade are a collection of numbers that might include the weighted results of a large number of different teacher-made tests, brief quizzes, and marks obtained on different assignments.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">The science of statistics is basically two things: descriptions, usually numerical, and a body of techniques used to make sense of observations. Thus, the number 117 might be a statistic that describes something specific, such as a student&#39;s mark on a 150-item mathematics test or the average intelligence test scores of a group of brilliant 5-year-olds. At the same time, the methods used to calculate the average of a group of intelligence test scores illustrate an important statistical technique.</p>

		<p class="key-point">Our main interest is in statistics as a body of methods for simplifying and making sense of numbers (see Figure 9.1).</p>

		<h2 class="h2">Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Statistics, as a collection of techniques, has two clear functions. One is to facilitate description; the other is to make possible intelligent inferences (predictions or logical conclusions). Accordingly, the study of statistics is often divided into two areas: <strong>descriptive statistics</strong> and <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. Both are of crucial importance in educational assessment.</p>

		<p class="key-point">Descriptive statistics refers to the use of numerical information to describe the characteristics of a sample.</p>
	
		<p class="txt">The sentence &quot;There are 24 students in my sixth-grade class, and they answered an average of 48 of the 60 ratio problems correctly&quot; illustrates descriptive statistics.</p>
	
		<p class="key-point">Inferential statistics involves mathematical procedures used for making predictions and inferences.</p>

		<p class="txt">The conclusion that this sixth-grade class is likely to benefit from exposure to more advanced mathematical problems, based on their performance on the ratio-unit test, is an inference. Similarly, the sentence &quot;There is a 90&#37; probability that it will rain today&quot; illustrates the use of inferential statistics.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">Uses of Statistics</h2>

		<figure class="photo-right"> <img src="images/9.1.jpg" alt="Weatherperson reports the weather on a news program." title="Weatherperson reports the weather on a news program." id="img9.1"/>
        <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">Digital Vision/Photodisc/Getty Images Plus</p>
          <p class="caption">Inferential statistics deals with procedures for making predictions and inferences based on data. It is used for <em>generalizing</em> and <em>predicting</em> rather than simply describing. Average maximum temperatures or precipitation readings are <em>descriptive</em> statistics. But the forecast that predicts Tuesday&#39;s maximum temperature illustrates <em>inferential</em> statistics.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

		<div class="single-column">
		<p class="txt">For some the science of statistics seems a difficult and not especially useful topic. Although some aspects of statistics are complex and difficult, much of it is very simple and very useful. Our lives are, in fact, filled with statistics.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">When we hear that the highest temperature ever recorded on earth was 134&#176;F in Death Valley, California, on July 10, 1913, that is a simple descriptive statistic. Perhaps more useful is the descriptive statistic that tells us that the average yearly temperature in Death Valley is 77.2&#176;F. However, if you are going to Death Valley today, perhaps more useful is the inferential statistic that forecasts (predicts) today&#39;s high temperature to be a mere 112&#176;F!</p>

		<p class="txt">Interpreting media reports, understanding educational research, and reacting intelligently to much of the information to which we are exposed requires, at the very least, a basic understanding of elementary statistics. Consider, for example, the <strong>Lake Wobegon effect</strong>. This phenomenon describes our tendency to overestimate our skills, our abilities, and our achievements relative to others. The effect is named after a fictitious Minnesota town where all the women were exceptionally strong, the men were all good-looking, and every child was above average.</p>

<a id="p359"></a>
		<p class="txt">In fact, most of us think we are above average in various ways. Thus, most students judge themselves to be more popular than others (Dunning, Heath, &#38; Suls, 2018). And most also overestimate their intelligence, knowledge, and achievement (Ehrlinger, Mitchum, &#38; Dweck, 2016). Even administrators and other authorities sometimes exaggerate the positive characteristics of their charges. For example, Cannell (2006) found that when states were asked to report their averages for elementary school achievement, every last one of them reported achievements that were higher than the national average.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">It might be useful to know that Cannell&#39;s finding is statistically impossible: not all schools (or individuals) can be above average! In the same way, it might be especially useful for teachers to be able to judge not only what is possible and impossible but also what is probable and improbable. The science of statistics provides an important basis for making these judgments. Among other things, statistics provides invaluable information for understanding numerical information; it clarifies the interpretation of graphical representations of data; and it explains what a confidence level is and what it means when you hear or read that something is significant at the .05 level.</p>

		<p class="key-point">Statistics is fundamentally important in education.</p>

		<p class="txt">In fact, almost all educational assessments deal with statistics. Both teacher-constructed and standardized tests almost invariably generate numbers, although a few&#8212;especially performance-based assessments&#8212;might also generate qualifiers such as <em>exemplary or in need of improvement</em>. Furthermore, most standardized tests provide any of a variety of descriptive statistics. These statistics typically include one or more of four kinds of information.</p>
		
		<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">how scores are distributed in the norming group (made up of all students who were administered the test when it was being developed)</li>
          <li class="li_text">what typical or average scores might be expected</li>
          <li class="li_text">the variability of scores</li>
          <li class="li_text">how scores on this test are related to other scores or other characteristics</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="txt">These four kinds of descriptive statistics can be highly useful for teacher-made tests. A score, by itself, doesn&#39;t mean very much. If Georgina&#39;s teacher tells her parents that she answered 72&#37; of the questions correctly on the arithmetic test, they will likely ask how the other students in the class did. And rather than read off every one of the 34 test scores, her teacher will describe the range and distribution of scores and the average performance of the class&#8212;all in terms that any parent can easily understand. As the next four sections demonstrate, most of these essential descriptive statistics are not very difficult to understand or to calculate.</p>

          <p class="caption">This formula does not simply look at the percentage of scores that fall below a score. Because a percentile rank is defined as the percentage &quot;<em>at</em> or below,&quot; a given point, it looks at the percentage of scores below the midpoint of the scores at a given level.

	<p class="txt">No score is ever at the 100th percentile, because one of the assumptions statisticians make is that scores or numbers are continuous. Thus, the number 8 represents a point halfway between 7.5 and 8.5. Another way of looking at it is to say that half the value of 8 lies between 7.5 and 8, and half lies between 8 and 8.5. If 8 is the top score in a distribution, there is nevertheless, according to this assumption, half the value of the score above it.</p>

	<p class="txt">As an example, if you ranked numbers 1 through 100 and these represented scores, the very top-ranked number (100) would be above the 99th percentile (99.5&#37; of all cases would fall below the midpoint of the top score). Using the formula shown in Figure 9.4, the calculation is as follows:</p>
	
		<p class="ext">[[<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>(1) + (99)]/100] &#215; 100 = 99.5</p>

   <p class="txt">This might seem like an unnecessarily complicated formula. In fact, there is a simpler formula that is often used:</p>

     <p class="ext">
		<table class="eqi_tbl2">
          <tbody>
            <tr class="eqi_txt_center">
              <td class="no_border1 middle_txt" width="100px;" rowspan="2">Percentile Rank</td>
			  <td class="no_border1 middle_txt" width="20px;" rowspan="2">&nbsp;=</td>
              <td class="no_border2" width="180px;">Number of scores below<em>&nbsp;x</em></td>
			  <td class="no_border1 middle_txt" width="30px;" rowspan="2">&nbsp;&#215;&nbsp;100</td>
            </tr>
			<tr class="eqi_no_backgound">
			  <td class="no_border2" width="180px;">total number of scores</td>
            </tr>
			</tbody>
        </table>
	  </p>
     
	<p class="txt">This simpler formula is generally adequate for most uses that a teacher might make of percentile ranks. Using it, for example, we quickly find that Farah&#39;s October percentile rank is 11/14 &#215; 100, which is 79 rather than 82; her November percentile rank is 93 rather than 96; and Amber&#39;s October rank is . . . ah! there is the problem. Two other students had exactly the same score as Amber. Is it accurate to say that there are 5 students below each of them when there are only 6 above them but there are a total of 14 students? Using the simple formula, each of these students would have a percentile rank of 5/14 &#215; 100, which is 36 rather than 46.</p>

	<p class="txt">The solution lies in the realization that, as pointed out earlier, mathematicians consider each number as occupying a range in which it is the midpoint. Thus, three identical numbers each occupy the same range, and half the value of each number lies below the midpoint of that range&#8212;and half lies above. Hence, if you want to be exact in your calculation of percentile rank, you take half the number of scores at a given point (therefore, half of 1 if there is only one score; half of 3 when there are 3 identical scores), add that to the number of lower scores, divide by the total number of scores, and multiply by 100.</p>

	<p class="txt">Another way of describing numerical data is to represent it graphically. For example, suppose Grendel makes his living manufacturing shoes for his fellow Norwegian trolls. One of the things he needs to know is what sizes are most common among his troll customers. So he does a quick and simple online survey and asks 100 randomly chosen, average trolls to reveal their exact shoe sizes. What should he do with the data to make it informative and useful? He doesn&#39;t need to know their average size, because he doesn&#39;t make shoes in anything other than standard troll sizes. Nor does he need to know the largest size of shoe&#8212;or the smallest&#8212;worn by the 100 trolls.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Histograms</h3>
	<p class="txt">What he needs to know is how many wear size 76, how many prefer size 80, and so on. So he counts the numbers that correspond to each size and plots them on a type of bar graph called a <strong>histogram</strong>, in which the height of the bar represents the frequency of each specific measure. The resulting histogram, shown in Figure 9.5, quickly reveals that the most common shoe size for his trolls is 82, which is worn by 30&#37; of the sample. Interestingly, 24&#37; wear size 86, but only 12&#37; wear size 84&#8212;all of which is absolutely vital information for a cobbler of his talents. But knowing that the average shoe size is 83.5 is about as useful as a new bottle of snake oil; he doesn&#39;t make shoes in that size. And if he did, nobody would buy them.</p>

	<p class="txt">As a classroom example, at the beginning of the school year a kindergarten teacher might plot on a histogram the number of letters of the alphabet each student is able to identify. The height of the bar corresponding to each letter would represent how many students know that letter, and it would allow the teacher to compare among letters.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Frequency Polygons</h3>
	<p class="txt">Another way of representing the frequency of a distribution of scores or measures is by plotting frequencies on a line graph, resulting in a <strong>frequency polygon</strong>. This accomplishes much the same thing as if you were to draw a line joining the upper midpoints of each of the columns in a histogram. Doing so for the distribution of troll shoes produces the graph shown in Figure 9.6. It contains the same information as the histogram does.</p>

	<p class="txt">Plotting kindergartners&#39; knowledge of letters on a frequency polygon would reveal which letters most of the class already knows and which are most difficult. This knowledge might be useful in planning the order in which new letters are introduced to the class. The polygon might also reveal that b&#39;s and d&#39;s or p&#39;s and q&#39;s are often confounded, a finding that might suggest valuable teaching strategies and interventions.</p>

If you look ahead in this chapter at the three scattergrams in Figure 9.15, you might notice that as long as the x- and y-axes are calibrated in ascending order from the lower left corner, when the plotted points angle upward and to the right, it means there is a positive relationship (a positive correlation) between the plotted variables (see Figure 9.15a). When the opposite pattern is apparent&#8212;when the plotted scores cluster together in an upper left to lower right direction&#8212;the variables are negatively correlated (see Figure 9.15b).

    <p class="txt">Let&#39;s say someone asks you how tall the elves are. First, you might say that the average height of all the elves measured is 33 millimeters (mm). The arithmetical average is called a <strong>mean</strong>. It is arrived at by adding all relevant scores (numbers, measurements), then dividing the total by the number of scores. In the example presented in Table 9.1, the heights of the 10 elves add up to 330. That number, divided by the number of cases (10), yields the mean (average) of their heights, which is 33. Here is the basic formula for calculating an average, applied to the heights of these 10 elves:</p>

	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">where the symbol <em>X&#772;</em> is used to indicate the mean of all the scores, <strong>&#8721;</strong> is the Greek letter meaning &quot;the sum of,&quot; the letter <em>X</em> refers to the scores, and <em>N</em> refers to the total number of scores.</p>
    
    <p class="key-point">The mean summarizes an entire collection of scores by saying something about the <em>center</em> point of a distribution.</p>

	<p class="txt">At the very least, knowing the average score on a third-grade mathematics test reveals who is performing above and below average, but only with respect to this particular assessment and this particular group of test takers.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">In mathematical terms, the mean is the point about which the sum of all differences is zero. If you were to subtract the mean from each height in Table 9.1 and add the 10 resulting differences (some of which would be positive, some zero, and others negative), the end result would be exactly zero.</p>

	<p class="key-point">The mean is the most commonly used measure of central tendency in most schools.</p>
   
	<p class="txt">For example, grades are often reported as the number that results from averaging a student&#39;s performance on a number of different exams, quizzes, assignments, and so on. Frequently, these means are what are termed <em>weighted averages</em>&#8212;so called because some of the elements that make up the average are given more importance than others (they are weighted differently). For example, a weighted average in a science class might attribute 10&#37; of the final grade to homework assignments, 20&#37; to quizzes, 20&#37; to weekly exams, and the remaining 50&#37; to the final exam. Suppose Miguel&#39;s grades were as follows: homework grade, 82; quizzes, 74; weekly exams, 68; and final exam, 94. The weighted average for these 4 elements would be calculated as follows: (.10)(82) + (.20)(74) + (.20)(68) + (.50)(94) = 83.6.</p>
   </div>
   </div>

	<h2 class="h2">The Median</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">A second measure of central tendency, called the median, is arrived at by ranking (arranging in order) all the scores and finding the midpoint of the distribution. The median is the point above and below which half the scores fall, respectively. Put another way, it is the 50th percentile.</p>

<a id="p369"></a>
	<p class="txt">In the example of the heights of 10 elves, the median (midpoint) happens to be identical to the mean when using the simplest approach for calculating the median: simply ranking the 10 measures and drawing a line halfway through the distribution. In this case the line would be between height measures of 33. Half the heights would fall above and below that number, which also happens to be the mean. Note, however, that if you use the more complex&#8212;and more accurate&#8212;formula shown in Figure 9.4, the percentile rank of a measure of 33 is not 50. In this distribution, it&#39;s actually 45.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">In other distributions, however, the mean and median might be quite different. For example, as illustrated in Figure 9.10, a handful of exceptionally high- or low-salaried employees in a business might raise or lower the mean significantly; however, their extreme salaries would have little effect on the median. In such a case, the median might be a better representation of central tendency than the mean.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">The Mode</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The third measure of central tendency, the <strong>mode</strong>, is nothing more complicated than the most frequently recurring score (or scores). Quite often this score will be almost identical to the mean and the median, as it is with respect to the heights of the 10 elves; the most frequent measure is 33. In other distributions, such as that shown in Figure 9.5, there may be two or more modes. The distribution for Norwegian troll shoe sizes is <strong>bimodal</strong>: One of the modes is 82; the other, 86. These are the two shoe sizes that occur considerably more often than any other. However, neither of these modes is identical to the mean or the median. In that distribution, the mean and median are both 83.5. There will never be more than one mean or median for a single distribution, no matter how many modes there might be.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<h2 class="h2">Mean, Median, or Mode?</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Each of these measures of central tendency is useful, but sometimes under different circumstances or for different purposes. Each measure provides a value to describe the central features of a collection of scores, but they can be quite different from each other.</p>

	<p class="txt">Of these three measures, the mean is used most often and is most useful in educational assessment. But in some circumstances, it can be misleading. If, for example, Grendel tells you that the average salary in his troll shoe factory is &#36;106,706.25, you might conclude that the factory workers are relatively well paid. But if the salary distribution were as depicted in Figure 9.10, you would be far more realistically informed if you knew instead that the median salary is only &#36;29,000 and the most common salary, the mode, a mere &#36;18,000.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The disadvantage of the mean, dramatically illustrated in this example, is that it is highly sensitive to extreme scores. The supervisor&#39;s salary of &#36;780,250 and the other high administrative salaries inflate the mean.</p>

	<p class="key-point">In contrast, both the mode and the median are less affected by extreme scores.</p>

	<p class="txt">In fact, the median sometimes presents a more accurate description of a distribution than does the mean. This might be the case in small classes where there are one or two extraordinarily high or low marks, as illustrated by the following scores obtained by the 8 students in a mathematics class: 12, 68, 79, 84, 84, 91, 95, 99. The mean of these scores is 76.5, a statistic that is not particularly meaningful, given that all learners except two performed above the average. In this case, the median, 84, is more indicative of class performance.</p>

	<p class="txt">Depending on the uses to which measures are being put, the mode can sometimes be the most useful measure of central tendency. A tailor isn&#39;t especially interested in knowing what the average suit jacket or shirt collar size is in North America. What she needs to know is which specific sizes are most common. That is, she needs to know the <em>mode</em> of shirt and jacket sizes&#8212;in much the same way as the cobbler needs to know the most common shoe sizes among trolls, elves, dwarves, hobbits, horses, and other shoed creatures.</p>

	<p class="key-point">The mode can be useful in various teaching/learning situations in which it is important to know which of several responses in most common, which type of problem is most difficult or easiest, or which activity is most or least popular.</p>

<a id="p371"></a>
	<p class="txt">For example, knowing the mode among common incorrect responses to simple mathematics problems&#8212;in other words, knowing which class of incorrect response is most frequent&#8212;can be invaluable in determining the teacher&#39;s next step (see <em>In the Classroom: Unfair Mean</em>).</p>

        <p class="txt">Jonah&#39;s marks are not very good. He lives in a one-parent, father-headed household, and he often misses classes when his dad&#39;s work shifts get changed and he has to look after his younger brothers. When he misses classes, he also misses assignments, and Mr. Adelson hands out zeros for every one of those. Sometimes Jonah has to miss quizzes and tests as well, and those, too, are zeros. In addition, he doesn&#39;t like be involved in class discussions, so he often gets a 5 out of 10 for participation.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">But usually, unless they are very narrowly focused on one or two lessons he might have missed, Jonah aces all tests and quizzes: 90s or high 80s.</p>

		<p class="txt">His grades? Distressing. Mr. Adelson uses only the most common measure of central tendency: the mean. So, when we add all of Jonah&#39;s zeros and 5 out of 10s, throw in a handful of 80s and 90s, and average the lot, we get a very low mean.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Would using the median instead of the mode be fairer? It would often result in a much higher grade for Jonah. But what about Jessica, who has a large collection of top marks and only one or two zeros? It is possible that her mean score would be considerably higher than her median score.</p>

	    <p class="txt">Do you think teachers should consider using different measures of central tendency? Should grades reflect only how well the student has achieved relative to learning objectives? Or should they also consider other factors like participation, attendance, manners, friendliness, and so on?</p>

	<p class="txt">The figure shows a <strong>normal distribution</strong> (or <strong>normal curve</strong>)&#8212;a mathematical abstraction to which most of the observations that concern us in the social sciences and in education conform. When we know that a set of observations, such as test scores, is distributed normally, we also know what a graphic representation of these scores would look like if we had enough of them. We know that most of the scores would cluster around the center&#8212;which is the mean (average score)&#8212;and that there would be progressively fewer scores as we move away from the mean.</p>

    <p class="key-point">This normal distribution, when represented graphically, is bell shaped and perfectly symmetrical.</p>

	<p class="txt">In its ideal form, it has certain important characteristics. For example, in a normal distribution, the mean, mode, and median all fall at the same point in the very center of the distribution. In Figure 9.12, that point is represented by the zero. Note that most of the scores are clustered around these measures of central tendency, and there are progressively fewer scores at either extreme.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">The Standard Deviation</h2>
	<div class="single-column"> 
    <p class="txt">Only two descriptive statistics are essential for representing a distribution that can be assumed to be normal. The first is the mean, which tells us where the midpoint of the distribution will be. The second is a measure of variation, which indicates how scores are distributed around this mean.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">The one measure of variation that we have mentioned thus far, the range, is the spread of scores: It is simply the difference between the highest score and the lowest score. As we saw when looking at the possible distribution of elf heights, because the range takes into consideration only the lowest and the highest scores, in most cases it says very little about how other scores might be distributed. What is needed, instead, is a measure of variability that takes into account every individual score. That measure is the <strong>standard deviation (SD)</strong>.</p>

	<p class="txt">Few teachers (or administrators) are likely to be asked to calculate standard deviations (most computer spreadsheet programs can automatically compute them for you). Still, doing so is not especially complicated or difficult. Basically, the standard deviation is arrived at in four steps.</p>

	<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">Calculate the deviation of each individual score in a distribution from the mean of the distribution (the deviation is simply the difference between each score and the mean).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Square and sum these deviations (if you don&#39;t square them, the sum will always be zero).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Find the average of the squared deviations by dividing their sum by the total number of scores.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Calculate the square root of the average squared deviation, and the result is the standard deviation.</li>
	</ol>

	<p class="txt">The procedure is summarized and illustrated in Figure 9.13 with respect to the heights of the 10 elves shown in Table 9.1. These measures of height could as easily be the results obtained by ten fourth-grade students on a 40-item spelling test.</p>

	<p class="txt">The value of knowing the standard deviation of a distribution lies in what we know about a normal distribution. As Figure 9.12 illustrates, within one standard deviation of the mean lie approximately two thirds of all scores; and within two standard deviations, 95&#37; of the scores can be found.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">Suppose I tell you that on the standardized test of mathematical ability you have just taken, the mean is 50 and the standard deviation is 10. Because results based on a standardization sample generally closely approximate a normal curve, you immediately know that two thirds of those taking the test would be expected to score between 40 and 60 (the mean plus and minus one standard deviation) and that 95&#37; of all individuals would score between 30 and 70 (the mean plus and minus two standard deviations). You also know that fewer than 5&#37; of the group would likely score below 30 and above 70. If you were one of those who scored above 70, you would likely be in the top 2.27&#37; of test takers.</p>

    <p class="txt">Not all distributions are normal, however. Some are <strong>skewed</strong> to the right; (positively skewed); others are skewed to the left (negatively skewed). If your class were exceptionally gifted, the distribution on an intelligence test might be skewed to the left&#8212;meaning that the bulk of the scores would be toward the high end of what is labeled the x-axis, and the tail of the distribution would stretch out to the left. (By convention, the vertical axis is called the y-axis.) If the class were less than gifted, the distribution might be skewed to the right, with a preponderance of the scores at the left (lower) end of the x-axis. Figure 9.14 shows examples of distributions skewed left and right.</p>

    <p class="txt">Follman (1991) found that the correlation between teachers&#39; estimates and actual measures is around .55. Chamorro-Premuzic, Arteche, Furnham, and Trickot (2009) later confirmed these findings in a study that also looked at students&#39; own estimates of their measured intelligence, as well as estimates given by their parents and teachers. In their study, the correlation between teacher ratings and actual measurements was .57; the correlation between the child&#39;s estimates and measured IQ was .44. And that between parental estimates and IQ was .65 for mothers and .58 for fathers. What does this mean?</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Positive and Negative Correlation</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt"><em>Correlation</em> is a frequently used term that is not always clearly understood. Two or more variables correlate if there is some systematic correspondence between them. Size of shoe correlates with size of sock, income correlates with standard of living, size of house correlates with number of windows, and drunkenness correlates with alcohol consumption.</p>

    <p class="txt">These are all examples of <strong>positive correlation</strong>: As one variable increases or decreases, so does its correlate. The inverse relationship, labeled <strong>negative correlation</strong>, means that as one variable increases, the other decreases. Correlations between number of wild animals and human populations, amount of pollutants in water and fish populations, and sobriety and alcohol consumption are all generally negative.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">There are various ways of calculating correlation. The most commonly used measure (called an <em>index</em> or <em>coefficient</em>) of correlation is <strong>Pearson&#39;s <em>r</em></strong>. It ranges in value from &#8211;1.00 to +1.00. (The symbol used for a correlation coefficient is usually <em>r</em>.) Each extreme (plus or minus 1) indicates perfect correlation, whereas zero indicates complete lack of relatedness (see Figure 9.15). The correlations between IQ scores and teachers&#39; estimates of intelligence reported by Follman (1991) and by Chamorro-Premuzic and associates (2009) were .55 and .57 respectively. This means there is a relatively high probability that if a teacher estimates a student&#39;s IQ as being high (or low), testing will reveal that it is high (or low).</p>

	<h2 class="h2">The Correlation Fallacy</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">Understanding correlations and what they mean is especially important for interpreting educational and psychological research. Say, for example, that you read the results of a study reported by Howell, Cater, Miller-Graff, Schwartz, and Graham-Bermann (2017), which found a high positive correlation between being abused as a child and various kinds of criminal behaviors as an adult. Can we reasonably conclude, on the basis of this positive correlation, that child abuse causes later criminal behavior?</p>

	<p class="txt">The simple answer is no. Believing that correlations, by themselves, are proof of causality illustrates the error in logic termed the <strong>correlation fallacy</strong>.</p>

	<p class="key-point">While it is true that if there is a causal relationship between two variables, there will be a correlation between them, the existence of a correlation does not prove causation.</p>

	<p class="txt">The fact that there is a correlation between shoe size and size of feet does not mean that big shoes cause feet to grow! And the strong positive correlation between the length of children&#39;s fingers and their academic accomplishments does not mean that having long fingers improves intellectual capacity&#8212;nor that having stubby ones dooms a child to mediocrity.</p>

	<p class="txt">As these cases illustrate, correlations are often due to a confounding variable, referred to as a <strong>third variable</strong>. Children with longer fingers perform better not because they have longer fingers but because they are older, and all sorts of changes that contribute to performance accompany getting older. Similarly, we cannot conclude solely on the basis of the Howell et al. (2017) study that child abuse causes criminality. Any of a number of confounding third variables is a possible explanation: Perhaps those who abuse their children are themselves violent and prone to criminal behavior, thereby serving as models of these behaviors for their children; or maybe these children are abused because they already manifest the defiant and violent characteristics of later criminality.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Often, especially in research, we are interested in knowing something about groups that we cannot directly observe, or we need to answer important questions that require us to go beyond descriptive statistics&#8212;that, in short, require us to make inferences. The branch of statistics that provides methods designed to make sure that our inferences are as sensible and realistic as possible is inferential statistics.</p>
	</div>

<a id="p379"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">An Example</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Let&#39;s assume that we are interested in the intelligence test scores of fourth-grade students in Texas. More specifically, we want to know the mean and standard deviation for intelligence for the entire population of Texas fourth graders.</p>

	<p class="txt">The term <strong>population</strong> refers to the entire collection of observations in which we are interested. In most cases, however, researchers do not have access to entire populations. Even when they do have access to them, obtaining the required measurements for every specific individual is practically and economically impossible. In such cases a representative <strong>sample</strong> is selected, and inferences about the entire population are made on the basis of the characteristics of the sample.</p>

    <p class="key-point">The validity of our inferences depends on the representativeness of our sample.</p>

	<p class="txt">If our sample of Texas fourth graders were chosen entirely from affluent urban families, our sample would be highly biased, and any inferences we might make about the entire population would be misleading.</p>

	<p class="txt">However, if the sample is sufficiently large and unbiased, we can reasonably assume that our measurements will be very close to what would be obtained if we were to measure the entire Texas population of fourth graders. Thus, if the average measured IQ of our sample is 102, then researchers can reasonably assume that the average IQ of fourth graders in Texas is around 102.</p>

    <p class="key-point">Inferential statistics provides specific techniques for determining how confidently we can generalize the results of our findings and measurements to larger populations.</p>

	<p class="txt">Indeed, in most cases research is far more interested in populations than in the samples drawn from these populations.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Teacher-Constructed Assessments and Inferences</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Making valid statistical inferences is important in a number of instances. For example, as we just saw, making valid inferences is critical when attempting to determine specific characteristics of a population, such as, the average intelligence test scores of 10-year-old urban children or the mathematical skills of 7-year-olds. In such cases the validity of inferences depends not only on how well samples represent the larger population but also on how accurately the tasks chosen to assess intelligence, mathematical skills, and so on actually measure those characteristics.</p>
        
	<p class="key-point">Making valid inferences is also centrally involved in teacher assessment of student performance.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">In a very real sense, a teacher-constructed test typically represents just a small sample of the behaviors a teacher might have selected for the assessment. When you prepare a test to gauge the mathematical skills of your fifth graders, you select what you think is a representative <em>sample</em> of the hundreds of tasks you might have selected. Your assumption, based on your expertise, is that the sample of tasks you select reflects the instructional goals that underlie your teaching of this unit in mathematics.</p>

	<p class="txt">One of the important objectives of teacher-based assessment is to permit inferences about learners&#8212;inferences such as &quot;Nadeem has mastered the manipulation of simple ratios and is ready to progress to the next unit.&quot; Or &quot;The entire class seems to have missed a critical concept. Time to review.&quot;</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What does significance mean in educational research?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">In many places throughout this text, the term <strong>significant</strong> has been used in connection with research results. For example, in Chapter 7 we referred to a finding reported by Weldeana and Sbhatu (2017) claiming that the use of portfolios can <em>significantly</em> improve student achievement and motivation. And in Chapter 5, we explained that Bokhove and Drijvers (2012) conclude there are <em>significant</em> gains in algebraic expertise as a result of specific approaches to formative assessment.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
	
	<h2 class="h2">What Significance Means</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	  <p class="txt">In these contexts, the term <em>significant</em> has a special meaning. An event or observation (or a collection of observations) is said to be <strong>statistically significant</strong> when it can reasonably be assumed not to be due to chance or random factors. Inferential statistics describes different ways of estimating the probability that observations are due to chance. Typically, events that would be expected to occur by chance no more than 5 times in 100 are said to be significant at the .05 level, although sometimes the decision is made to consider an event significant if it occurs no more than once in 100 times, a level of significance of .01. The conclusion is often expressed as involving a probability that is smaller than .05 (written as &#60; .05). This simply means that these events are most likely the results of factors other than chance&#8212;that they will occur by chance fewer than 5 times in 100 (or fewer than 1 time in 100).</p>

	  <p class="key-point">In other words, the events represent real rather than chance observations.</p>


      <p class="txt">Consider, for example, the problem of determining whether an <strong>experimental group</strong>&#8212;the group subjected to some kind of special treatment&#8212;is really different from a <strong>control group</strong>&#8212;the group that is simply used for comparison purposes. Assume that after the experimental treatment, the means of the two groups are in fact mathematically different. Can you conclude immediately that the groups are really different and that the experimental treatment was therefore effective?</p>

<a id="p381"></a>
	  <p class="txt">Perhaps not. It is possible that the observed difference between the means is due to chance factors. If the difference between the means is slight, or if the samples are small, the likelihood that the difference is due to chance is considerably greater than if the samples are huge or the difference is very large. We know intuitively that the mean intelligence test scores of 20 samples, each consisting of only 5 individuals, may vary a great deal by chance. But the means of 20 such samples, each consisting of 2,000 individuals, will be very similar.</p>

          <p class="cr">Wragg/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
          <p class="caption">We find events that rarely occur by chance <em>significant</em>, and we generate hypotheses to explain them. Inferential statistics provides techniques for testing our educated guesses. To explain the rare event shown here, we might hypothesize cheating rather than plain luck&#8212;especially if it occurs again.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">A number of techniques that are widely used in inferential statistics permit researchers to infer the distribution characteristics (mean and standard deviation, for example) of differences between means. Once this has been done, it is a simple matter to determine whether observed differences would occur more or less than 5 times in 100 <em>by chance</em>. Differences that would be expected to occur less than 5&#37; of the time by chance are usually considered significant: They are assumed to represent real differences between groups.</p>

	<p class="txt">In much the same way, inferential statistics provides methods for describing expected outcomes with respect to measures of relationship (correlation). Expected outcomes are those that would exist if observations were the result of chance factors. Whenever there is a dramatic departure from what would be expected by chance (a less than 5&#37; probability of the observation having occurred solely as a result of chance factors), researchers make the inference that other factors are involved. Thus, a relationship between two sets of observations (intelligence and achievement, for example) is said to be significant if it would be expected only rarely by chance.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<h2 class="h2">Confidence Intervals</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">In psychological research, significance refers to the probability that a result might have occurred purely by chance. Statistical tests of significance typically yield a <em>yes</em> or a <em>no</em> conclusion: The result is significant (it would have occurred by chance less than a given percentage of the time) or it isn&#39;t significant (it would have occurred by chance more than a specified percentage of the time).</p>

<a id="p382"></a>
	<p class="txt">Another approach to making inferences in statistics is to determine a <strong>confidence interval</strong>. This is a range within which a measure or observation is expected to fall with a specific level of confidence. For example, calculating a confidence interval with respect to the intelligence test results of the sample of fourth-grade Texas students might result in a 95&#37; confidence interval of 99.3 to 103.4. What this means is that if you were to randomly select 100 similar samples from the entire population of Texas fourth graders, 95 of them would have average measured IQ scores between 99.3 and 103.4. As a teacher, if your class average were outside this confidence interval, you might reasonably conclude that your class is better than or not as good as comparable Texas fourth graders with respect to measured intelligence.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What role do inferences play in the scientific method?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
   <p class="intro">Loosely defined, the scientific method may be seen as a collection of attitudes and procedures that allow scientists to investigate phenomena in an objective way and that increase the probability that the conclusions based on these investigations will be valid.</p>
   
   </div>
  <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">

    <p class="txt">The techniques of statistical inference are an intrinsic part of the scientific method. Also important are <strong>hypotheses&#8212;</strong>statements about relationships among variables that can be true or false and whose probability of being true or false can be estimated with statistical methods.</p>
  </div> 

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">An Illustration</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Suppose, by way of illustration, that you have volunteered to participate in research apparently designed to examine the hypothesis that both men and women are more likely to be dishonest when being interviewed by members of the opposite sex. You, and all other subjects, are told that you will be interviewed on six different occasions and that the interviewers will be randomly selected from a pool of potential interviewers consisting of equal numbers of men and women. Thus, each interviewee would have an equal chance of being interviewed either by a man or by a woman on any given occasion.</p>

	<p class="txt">Happy to be of service in the cause of science, you appear punctually for each of the six interviews. Being both rational and intelligent, you are not at all surprised when the first interviewer is male or when the second is also male. When the third is again male, you begin to wonder whether the interviewers are indeed being selected randomly; and when the fourth, fifth, and sixth are also male, you might conclude that the experimenters have deliberately chosen to have you interviewed only by men, despite their claims to the contrary. At this point you can make use of some simple methods of statistical inference to determine whether you are justified in your suspicions.</p>

	<p class="txt">Your hypothesis might be worded as follows: &quot;The fact that I was interviewed by six males in a row is due to chance.&quot; The alternative hypothesis, one that would be accepted as most likely to be true if the first were rejected, might be stated in this way: &quot;The fact that I was interviewed by six males is not due to chance: It was accomplished deliberately.&quot;</p>
	</div>
	</div>

<a id="p383"></a>
	<h2 class="h2">Calculating Chance Probabilities</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The general model of statistical inference now requires that you estimate the chance probabilities of each possibility. In this case the estimates can be calculated quite simply since, if chance is the determining factor, the probability of being interviewed by a man or a woman should be equal on each occasion (i.e., 1 out of 2). The entire procedure would be much like that of flipping a fair coin that, over a large number of flips, will come out heads and tails approximately equally often. During the interviews, therefore, the most likely event is that you will be interviewed by three women and by three men, although it is possible that you will be interviewed by five of one and one of the other, or even by six of one.</p>

	<p class="txt">Your task is simply to determine the likelihood of this last possibility. This can be done mathematically as follows: On the occasion of each interview, the probability of being interviewed by a male is 1 out of 2; since each of the interviews is an independent event (the probability of being interviewed by a man or a woman is unaffected by what happened on the previous occasion), the probability of being interviewed by a man six times in a row is &#189; &#215; &#189; &#215; &#189; &#215; &#189; &#215; &#189; &#215; &#189; &#215; = 1/64 or .016.</p>

	<p class="txt">Another way of arriving at the same estimate is to compute all possibilities, as shown in Figure 9.16. Note that there are 64 possible combinations, only 1 of which is all men (and one of which is all women).</p>

	<p class="txt">After doing this exercise, you know that being interviewed by six persons of the same sex in these circumstances is rare under the influence of chance alone. In fact, you might reasonably expect that only 1 out of every 64 people being interviewed (on average) will have been examined either by men only or by women only. You are now in a position to reject your first hypothesis. Being interviewed by six men in a row is significantly different from what might be expected by chance more than 5&#37; of the time.</p>

	<p class="txt">But you might be wrong.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Statistical manipulations do not guarantee truth, although they do make it more probable. It is important to keep in mind that research in the social sciences, as elsewhere, is subject to two types of error: that of accepting a false hypothesis and that of rejecting a true hypothesis. Wise use of statistical inference minimizes these errors but does not eliminate them.</p>

    <div class="single-column">
      <h3 class="h3"> &quot;Lies, Damned Lies, and Statistics&quot;</h3>
      <p class="txt">Statistics is the science that deals with numerical data (singular: <em>datum</em>). The word can also refer to a single numerical fact or to a collection of such facts or data. One branch of the science, <em>descriptive statistics</em>, provides ways of describing a collection of measures, scores, or other data. The other, inferential statistics, provides techniques for making generalizations (inferences) based on data.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Representing Numerical Values</h3>
      <p class="txt">Statistics that are useful for sorting and representing a collection of numerical data include simple ranking (first, second, third, etc.) and percentile ranks, which indicate the percentage of scores that fall at or below a given point. Also useful are graphical representations of the data in the form of one of a variety of graphs (including bar and column graphs, line graphs, pie charts, histograms, frequency polygons, and scattergrams).</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Measures of Central Tendency</h3>
      <p class="txt">When plotted, large collections of data, such as achievement test scores, tend to display a <em>normal distribution</em>, in which scores cluster near the center of the distribution and are spread around the center in predictable fashion. The <em>mean</em> (average) is the point about which the sum of all differences from each score is zero. The <em>median</em> is the point above and below which 50&#37; of all scores or measures fall (the 50th percentile). The <em>mode</em> is the most frequently recurring score. A distribution may have more than one mode but will always have only one median and one mean.</p>

	  <h3 class="h3">Measures of Variation</h3>
      <p class="txt">The simplest description of variation, the <em>range</em>, indicates the spread between the lowest and the highest value. More useful for data that approximates a normal distribution is the <em>standard deviation</em>, which indicates approximately how many values will be found within a precise distance from the mean (roughly two thirds of all cases lie within one standard deviation of the mean, and 95&#37; lie within two standard deviations).</p>

<a id="p385"></a>
	  <h3 class="h3">Correlation</h3>
      <p class="txt">A common measure of relationship is the correlation coefficient, of which there are various kinds. The most frequently used is Pearson&#39;s <em>r</em>, a measure that ranges from &#8211;1.00 (perfect negative correlation) to +1.00 (perfect positive correlation). A high positive correlation between two variables indicates that as one variable increases, so does the other. A high negative correlation indicates that as one increases, the other tends to decrease. If one event causes another, there will be a positive correlation between them. However, the presence of a high correlation does not prove causation. Believing that this is the case often leads to a <em>correlation fallacy</em>.</p>
		
	  <h3 class="h3">Making Inferences</h3>
      <p class="txt">Making inferences in research often involves generalizing what is known about the characteristics of a sample to the larger population from which the sample is drawn. Similarly, teachers make inferences about student learning and performance based on assessments that attempt to sample representative skills and behaviors. Inferential statistics provides techniques for estimating the probability that observations are due to chance. Most of these are based on the assumption that random (chance) events are normally distributed. Events that would not be expected to occur by chance more than 5&#37; of the time are often considered to be <em>significant</em>. A <em>confidence interval</em> is a range of values within which a given parameter such as a population mean is expected to fall a specified percentage of the time.</p>

<p class="reveal">A distribution that is symmetrical and tends to reflect the outcomes of chance events; most events cluster around the mean, with fewer and fewer cases toward the extreme ends of the distribution.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>Pearson&#39;s <em>r</em></strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A correlation coefficient (product&ndash;moment correlation) that indicates the magnitude and direction of relationship between two numerical variables. Its maximum values are from &ndash;1.00 (perfect negative relationship) to +1.00 (perfect positive relationship). </p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>percentile rank</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A rank defined in terms of the percentage of cases that fall below a given point.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>pie chart</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A graphical, circular representation of data in which wedges indicate relative proportions of parts in relation to the whole.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>population</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">In an experiment, the group to which results are to be generalized. The group from which an experimental sample is drawn.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>positive correlation</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">The type of relationship that exists between two variables when high or low scores on one are associated with correspondingly high or low scores on the other.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>range</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">In a distribution, the difference between the highest score and the lowest score. The spread of scores.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>ranking</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">Ordering in terms of some dimension&mdash;often numerical or alphabetical&mdash;or in terms of any other characteristic susceptible to systematic variation, such as hair color.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>sample</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A selection of examples from a parent population that is representative of the entire population.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>scattergram</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A graph that marks the various points where two values for the same population lie on a graph when one value is plotted on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>significant</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">In research, refers to conclusions based on observations that cannot reasonably be attributed to chance or random factors.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>skewed</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A term used to describe a distribution in which most of the scores fall above or below an expected average.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>standard deviation (SD)</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A measure of how scores are dispersed around the mean. In a <em>normal</em> distribution, scores are dispersed in such a way that approximately two thirds of all scores are within one standard deviation of the mean. When scores are spread further apart, the standard deviation is larger.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>statistically significant</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">Descriptive of events or observations that are unlikely to have resulted by chance.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>statistics</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">The science that deals with numerical data. Also, a collection of numerical data (singular, <em>datum</em>).</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>third variable</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">A variable that can confound the results of an experiment, leading to false inferences about causation.</p>

	<p class="tx"><a href="#" class="answerToggle"><strong>variable</strong></a>&ensp;</p>
<p class="reveal">Any quality or characteristic that can vary&mdash;that can have different values.</p>
