        <p class="txt">People, too, sometimes give the wrong answers on tests because they get nervous and scared.
          That&#39;s what often happened to Jacob. Tests scared the pants off him. When he sat down to take one, he
          would quickly forget every sensible thought and well-memorized fact he had stuffed into his brain. His test
          results were a disaster. They greatly chagrined his mother&mdash;especially when, following a series of
          countywide achievement tests, the principal called her in.</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;Jacob should probably stop dreaming about going to university and becoming a
          professor,&quot; said the principal. &quot;There&#39;s other stuff he can do.&quot;</p>
        <p class="txt">But Jacob didn&#39;t stop dreaming. He just kept trying to educate himself. &quot;They
          can&#39;t teach me more stuff just by giving me more tests,&quot; he declared. &quot;That&#39;s about as
          sensible as thinking you can make yourself thinner just by weighing yourself a lot.&quot;</p>

      <p class="intro">Jacob was a bright young man (his uncle once described him as having a brain as big as a planet).
        But he suffered from what psychologists label <strong>test anxiety</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body bg-1">
      <p class="txt">The mere thought of any sort of assessment, and the fear that he would not do well, invariably
        led to a frayed emotional state that interfered with Jacob&#39;s ability to perform well on tests. As he
        explained it, school assessments made him feel like a cat that is falling with its back to the ground and just
        can&#39;t seem to get its feet pointed the right way.</p>
      <p class="txt">Assessment can be like that for some students&mdash;highly threatening and anxiety provoking.
        This is especially the case when the student&#39;s performance has profound implications, not only for the
        learner but perhaps also for the teacher, the school, the parents, and others. Such situations are labeled
        <strong>high-stakes testing</strong> environments (these are discussed more in Chapter 10).</p>
      <p class="txt">But assessment in many of today&#39;s schools is very different from what it was in Jacob&#39;s
        school, which at the time was more focused on performance. </p>
      <p class="key-point">In fact, the best current approaches to classroom assessment are designed less to determine
        how well or how poorly students perform and more to help them learn.</p>
      <p class="txt">Such approaches to testing might well have uncovered Jacob&#39;s problem and helped him before he
        abandoned all hope.</p>
      <p class="txt">This chapter looks at current approaches to educational assessment and its various purposes and
        forms. It explains how assessment is driven by the main, overriding goals of the educational enterprise, how
        curricula are designed around these goals, and how assessments are used to gauge the extent to which goals are
        being met. It looks at the implications of various pieces of legislation that direct and influence educational
        endeavors. It examines some of the rules and regulations designed to ensure that assessments are as fair,
        useful, and ethical as possible. Finally, it looks at what we know about approaches that work in education.

  <!--Section 1.2
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////-->
  <section class="page" id="sec1.2">
    <div class="section-header">
      <h1 class="h1"><span class="sec_number">1.2</span> <span class="sec_title">Purposes and Types of Assessment</span>
      </h1>
      <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the most important
          purposes of educational assessment? How are summative, formative, and placement assessments different?</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Educational assessment has two broad purposes: The most important, strongly reflected in
        today&#39;s assessment literature, is to improve teaching and learning (e.g., Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2017).
        That purpose is emphasized throughout this text. The second purpose is to measure student achievement in order
        to provide a grade.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body bg-1">
      <h2 class="h2">Summative Assessment</h2>
      <p class="key-point">Assessment that is mainly used to provide a midterm or year-end grade, or to assess mastery
        at the end of a unit, is called <strong>summative assessment</strong>.</p>
      <p class="txt">Summative assessment has traditionally been the main function of testing in schools, partly
        because its historical emphasis has been on sorting learners to select those with the highest probability of
        future success. Selecting students is no longer the principal mission of our schools, as Stiggins and Chappuis
        (2017) explain.</p>
      <p class="key-point">Schools increasingly need to ensure that learners know how to learn&mdash;that they become
        competent, self-directed learners who are actively involved in their own education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment</h2>
      <p class="txt">Assessment designed to improve the teaching/learning process is called <strong>formative
          assessment</strong>. It consists of the huge variety of methods teachers use to assess and assist learner
        progress and comprehension during a lesson, course, or unit. </p>
      <p class="key-point">Put another way, formative assessment is assessment <em>for</em> learning; summative
        assessment is assessment <em>of</em> learning.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
      <p class="txt">Formative assessment is that which is embedded in the teaching&ndash;learning process. Much of
        it is informal rather than structured and formal. It has the following features:</p>
      <ul class="bl">
        <li class="li_text">It consists of ongoing strategies such as questions, quizzes, and observation of student
          performances and products.</li>
        <li class="li_text">It involves providing frequent and timely feedback aimed directly at improving teaching
          and learning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="key-point">Instead of summarizing achievement with a number or grade (summative assessment),
        formative assessment provides information that a teacher and learner can put to use before formal grading
        occurs.</p>
      <h3 class="h3">Key to Assessment in Schools</h3>
      <p class="txt">As Hattie (2012) puts it, &quot;The primary function of assessment is to support learning by
        generating feedback that students can act upon in terms of where they are going, how they are going there,
        and where they might go next&quot; (p. 126). </p>
      <p class="key-point">Hence, the primary purpose of assessment in schools is (or should be) formative.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body bg-1">
      <h2 class="h2">Placement Assessment</h2>
      <p class="key-point">As the name implies, <strong>placement assessment</strong> is designed to provide
        information relating to a learner&#39;s placement.</p>

      <p class="txt">It typically occurs prior to an instructional sequence and looks at the learner&#39;s readiness
        for a lesson, unit, course, or entire program. </p>

      <p class="txt">Placement assessment often includes <strong>diagnostic assessment</strong>, which is directed
        specifically at identifying learning strengths or problems and their underlying causes. For example,
        diagnostic assessment might be used to determine whether a learner would benefit from being placed in a group
        that receives remedial instruction in reading or mathematics. </p>

      <p class="txt">Of course, the fact that both learners and educational emphases are changing does not mean that
        all teachers stress the formative role of assessment over its summative uses. Some critics point out that many
        of today&#39;s schools still reflect the approaches and emphases of the past. Groshell (2017), for example,
        notes that although there have been enormous advances in both technology and educational goals, relatively
        little has changed regarding how schools view learning and how they design the learning environment. Still,
        there is little doubt that the uses and purposes of educational assessment are changing&mdash;and even less
        doubt that they should.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <h2 class="h2">Performance-Based Assessment</h2>
      <p class="txt">Another important category of educational assessment is <strong>performance-based
          assessment</strong>. </p>

      <p class="key-point">Performance-based assessments ask learners to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and
        understanding by actually performing a task or producing a product that directly illustrates what is being
        assessed. </p>

      <p class="txt">Thus, performance-based assessments can be used for both formative and summative purposes. </p>

      <p class="txt">For example, asking first grader William to read aloud from one of the work sheets that
        accompanies the <em>Beginning Reader</em> series is a performance-based assessment. Judging William&#39;s
        performance according to a <strong>rubric</strong>, a type of scoring guide described in Chapter 7 and shown
        in Table 1.1, provides a basis for using the descriptor <em>Meets Standard</em> on his electronic report
        card. This would be an example of using performance assessment for <em>summative</em> purposes.</p>

      <p class="txt">If, in the course of observing and assessing William&#39;s reading performance, his teacher
        notes that he consistently confuses the letters <em>b</em> and <em>d</em>&mdash;a common error&mdash;she can
        use this information to adjust her instructional approach and provide William with additional help. This
        illustrates how performance-based assessment can be used for <em>formative</em> purposes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body bg-1">
      <h2 class="h2"> Bringing It All Together </h2>
      <p class="txt">To summarize: As Figure 1.1 illustrates, assessment might occur before instruction and could be
        the basis for decisions regarding a learner&#39;s placement (placement assessment). Placement assessment might
        also involve <em>diagnostic assessment</em>, the main purpose of which is to identify a learner&#39;s
        strengths and weaknesses, diagnose learning problems, and even uncover the reasons for them.]</p>

      <p class="txt">Assessment that occurs during instruction is <em>formative</em> to the extent that it provides
        feedback to assist in the learning process. Formative assessment is an integral part of the
        teaching&ndash;learning process, rather than something that occurs only before or after instruction.
        Assessment that occurs after instruction is usually <em>summative</em>: Its purpose is to summarize learner
        progress and achievement. Formative assessment is further discussed in Chapter 5; summative assessment is
        detailed in Chapter 6; and performance-based assessment is the subject of Chapter 7.</p>

          mainly summative, formative, or intended for placement decisions, the overriding purpose of educational
          assessment is to improve student learning.</p>

    <div class="section-body">
      <p class="key-point">Note that although assessing, planning, and teaching are shown as distinct activities, they
        constantly overlap. </p>

      <p class="txt">Assessment occurs before, during, and after teaching. Planning and modifying approaches to
        instruction and to learning&mdash;all of which rely on good assessment&mdash;are continuous, ongoing
        processes. </p>

      <p class="txt">The most useful assessments for instructional purposes are informal and frequent ungraded
        assessments that inform both the teacher&#39;s and the students&#39; minute-to-minute and day-to-day
        activities.</p>

      <h2 class="h2"> Some Definitions</h2>

      <p class="txt">Many of the commonly used terms in assessment literature&mdash;terms like <em>test</em>,
        <em>assessment</em>, <em>mea</em><em>surement</em>, and <em>evaluation</em>&mdash;are treated as though they
        are synonymous. They aren&#39;t. Table 1.2 briefly summarizes the differences.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Test</h3>

      <p class="key-point">In education, the word <strong>test</strong> typically refers to specific instruments or
        procedures designed to measure student achievement or progress, or to identify various student
        characteristics. </p>

      <p class="txt"><strong>Tests</strong> typically consist of a sample of behaviors (responses) that serve as a
        basis for making inferences. For example, a ninth-grade algebra final test does not examine students&#39;
        complete body of algebraic knowledge or their ability to solve all problems related to the entire course.
        Instead, the test consists of a representative sample of problems. If a student responds correctly to 84% of
        the problems, the examiner infers that the student also would have responded correctly to 84% of the entire
        pool of relevant problems. </p>

      <p class="txt">Test results are often <em>quantitative</em> in that they provide a numerical measure, such as
        90%, or a grade with clear meaning, such as a B. However, sometimes they are <em>qualitative</em>, in that
        they describe some particular quality such as <em>Meeting all standards</em> or <em>Excellent descriptive
        </em><em>paragraph</em>. Whether tests are developed by the teacher or are commercially prepared, they are a
        relatively formal approach to assessment. They are commonly used in placement and summative assessment but
        less so in formative assessment, which tends to be more informal.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Measurement</h3>

      <p class="txt">Measurements are usually quantitative: They are used to indicate an amount. Thus, I
        <em>measure</em> the length of my foot in inches or centimeters; but I can <em>test</em> its suitability for
        running by putting it through a series of movements. </p>

      <p class="key-point"><strong>Measurement </strong>in education is usually based on the results of tests.
        Strictly speaking, educational measurement is a set of procedures for manipulating and interpreting test
        results. </p>

      <p class="txt">For example, educational measurement might involve making decisions about specific levels of
        performance that are acceptable in a unit test or that identify learners who need assistance.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Assessment</h3>

      <p class="txt"><em>Assessment</em> is a more general term. </p>

      <p class="key-point">In an educational setting, <strong>assessment</strong> refers to all the
        activities&mdash;including testing and measuring&mdash;undertaken by a teacher to obtain information about
        students&#39; characteristics, their progress and achievement, and the effectiveness of instructional
        methods in relation to desired outcomes. </p>

      <p class="txt">There is a strong belief that in the 21st century, assessment should be a collaborative process
        that engages both learner and teacher, and perhaps involves parents as well. In this sense, assessment
        reflects a commitment to achievement and progress, and recognizes that assessment-based feedback is an
        essential component of the teaching&ndash;learning cycle. </p>

      <p class="txt">Educational assessment is no longer viewed as a mysterious, secretive, teacher-controlled
        process. Today&#39;s learner should be able to access assessment-based, formative feedback in collaboration
        with the teacher&mdash;perhaps by means of face-to-face interactions or via online, digital technology.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Evaluation</h3>

      <p class="txt">Literally, <em>evaluation</em> refers to the process of making a value judgment. It may involve
        deciding that something is good or bad, moral or immoral, effective or ineffective. </p>

      <p class="txt">In education, however, evaluation is seldom as subjective as this definition might imply.</p>

      <p class="key-point"><strong>Evaluation </strong>is usually based on the results of one or more assessments,
        and it often takes the form of an appraisal based on whether certain criteria have been met. </p>

      <p class="txt">For example, determining whether a student qualifies for special needs services in primary
        grades usually requires the use of specific evaluation criteria related to speech and language difficulties,
        social and emotional problems, or behavioral problems.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Grade</h3>

      <p class="key-point"><strong>Grades</strong> are generally numbers, letters, or verbal descriptors that
        describe a particular rank or quality. </p>

      <p class="txt">Thus, there are different grades of beef, lumber, wheat, paper&mdash;and even students. </p>

      <p class="key-point">In education, grades are summative rather than formative. </p>

      <p class="txt">They are usually based on the results of tests or on other forms of assessment. Occasionally,
        as we will see in Chapter 11, they might also reflect other factors such as performance on assignments or
        class participation. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body bg-1">
      <h2 class="h2"> What We Measure</h2>
      <p class="txt">Assessments, measurements, and evaluations are a huge part of everyday life. You have been
        subjected to assessments of one kind or another for your whole life. </p>

      <a id="p10"></a>
      <h3 class="h3">Everyday Assessment</h3>

      <p class="txt">In all likelihood, within a few minutes of being born, a nurse or attending physician gave you
        the well-known <strong>Apgar test</strong>&mdash;a test that assessed your general
        <u><strong>a</strong></u>ppearance (blue or pink); your <u><strong>p</strong></u>ulse (heart rate); your
        <u><strong>g</strong></u>rimace (reflexive reactions such as coughing, sneezing, crying, or grimacing); your
        <u><strong>a</strong></u>ctivity level (muscle tone described as limp, weak, or strong); and your
        <u><strong>r</strong></u>espiration. </p>

      <h3 class="h3">Educational Assessment</h3>

      <p class="key-point">In many ways, life is a series of formal and informal assessments.</p>

      <p class="txt">Some show how well you are performing compared to your peers; others appraise your performance
        relative to some standard or norm that describes expected or average behavior or achievement. </p>

      <p class="txt">And of course, the preschool and school experiences that follow bring with them a whole range of
        new assessments. At the very least, schools typically measure student achievement; most also assess various
        kinds of aptitude or ability. They might also examine personality, vocational and career interests, and
        performance in different subject areas. </p>

      <p class="txt">Some of the assessments used involve formal measuring instruments, often produced by professional
        test developers. Others are constructed by teachers. </p>

      <p class="txt">Often, too, assessment is based on more informal kinds of observations made both in and outside
        the classroom. Some of the various types of school assessments are described in Table&nbsp;1.4.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">How We Use Results</h2>

      <p class="txt">The chief purpose of any educational assessment is to foster learning. However, each of the
        broad assessment approaches described in Table 1.4 might serve a variety of purposes in the classroom,
        including the following.</p>
      <ul class="bl">
        <li class="li_text">determining whether learning goals are being met</li>
        <li class="li_text">assessing the effectiveness of instructional methods</li>
        <li class="li_text">gauging the extent to which learners are engaged in learning</li>
        <li class="li_text">monitoring student achievement</li>
        <li class="li_text">providing information for parents</li>
        <li class="li_text">satisfying administrative and judicial requirements</li>
        <li class="li_text">appraising learner satisfaction and happiness</li>
        <li class="li_text">determining student background information and readiness to learn</li>
        <li class="li_text">helping learners make wise decisions</li>
        <li class="li_text">developing self-assessment skills among learners</li>
        <li class="li_text">making decisions about student advancement and placement</li>
        <li class="li_text">advising students regarding career and vocational decisions</li>
        <li class="li_text">tailoring instructional methods to student aptitudes and interests</li>

      <h2 class="h2"> What Information Learners Need</h2>
      <p class="txt">Most of the uses for educational assessment are not mutually exclusive. A single,
        well-constructed, teacher-made, end-of-unit test might serve every one of the purposes just listed. </p>

      <p class="key-point">However, the kind of assessment information the learner needs is quite different from the
        assessment information that might be given to parents.</p>

      <p class="txt">Interested parties such as parents, prospective employers, and university admissions officers are
        mainly interested in summative information that allows them to compare and evaluate. That is, they want to
        know what the learner has achieved relative to educational goals and relative to other learners. On that
        basis, they can predict what the learner is capable of, provide advice about educational and career options,
        and make decisions about placement.</p>

      <p class="key-point">In contrast, what learners need in the day-to-day business of learning is immediate,
        personalized, confidential information about their learning. They need formative information that will enhance
        their ongoing development. </p>
