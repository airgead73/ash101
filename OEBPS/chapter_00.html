  <div class="page_lead">
      <p class="intro">Jacob was a bright young man (his uncle once described him as having a brain as big as a planet). But he suffered
          from what psychologists label <strong>test anxiety</strong>.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="page_body">
      <p class="txt">The mere thought of any sort of assessment, and the fear that he would not do well, invariably led to a
          frayed emotional state that interfered with Jacob&#39;s ability to perform well on tests. As he explained it, school
          assessments made him feel like a cat that is falling with its back to the ground and just can&#39;t seem to get its
          feet pointed the right way.</p>

        <p class="txt">Assessment can be like that for some students&mdash;highly threatening and anxiety provoking. This is
          especially the case when the student&#39;s performance has profound implications, not only for the learner but
          perhaps also for the teacher, the school, the parents, and others. Such situations are labeled <strong>high-stakes
            testing</strong> environments (these are discussed more in Chapter 10).</p>
        <p class="txt">But assessment in many of today&#39;s schools is very different from what it was in Jacob&#39;s school,
          which at the time was more focused on performance. </p>
        <p class="key-point">In fact, the best current approaches to classroom assessment are designed less to determine how
          well or how poorly students perform and more to help them learn.</p>
        <p class="txt">Such approaches to testing might well have uncovered Jacob&#39;s problem and helped him before he
          abandoned all hope.</p>
        <p class="txt">This chapter looks at current approaches to educational assessment and its various purposes and forms.
          It explains how assessment is driven by the main, overriding goals of the educational enterprise, how curricula are
          designed around these goals, and how assessments are used to gauge the extent to which goals are being met. It looks
          at the implications of various pieces of legislation that direct and influence educational endeavors. It examines
          some of the rules and regulations designed to ensure that assessments are as fair, useful, and ethical as possible.
          Finally, it looks at what we know about approaches that work in education.</p>

  <h1 class="h1" id="test1-2">1.2 Purposes and Types of Assessment</h1>

  <div class="page_lead">
      <p class="intro">Educational assessment has two broad purposes: The most important, strongly reflected in today&#39;s assessment literature, is to improve teaching and learning (e.g., Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2017). That purpose is emphasized throughout this text. The second purpose is to measure student achievement in order to provide a grade.</p>
  </div>  

  <div class="page_body-bg1">
    <h2 class="h2">Summative Assessment</h2>

    <p class="key-point">Assessment that is mainly used to provide a midterm or year-end grade, or to assess mastery at the end of a unit, is called <strong>summative assessment</strong>.</p>
		<p class="txt">Summative assessment has traditionally been the main function of testing in schools, partly because its historical emphasis has been on sorting learners to select those with the highest probability of future success. Selecting students is no longer the principal mission of our schools, as Stiggins and Chappuis (2017) explain.</p>
    <p class="key-point">Schools increasingly need to ensure that learners know how to learn&mdash;that they become competent, self-directed learners who are actively involved in their own education.</p>
        
  </div>
  <div class="page_body-bg2">
    <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment</h2>
    <figure class="photo-landscape">
        <figcaption>
        
            <p class="caption">One of the goals of ESSA is that all students be taught to high academic standards.</p>

    </figure>     
    <p class="txt">Assessment designed to improve the teaching/learning process is called <strong>formative assessment</strong>. It consists of the huge variety of methods teachers use to assess and assist learner progress and comprehension during a lesson, course, or unit. </p>
    <p class="key-point">Put another way, formative assessment is assessment <em>for</em> learning; summative assessment is assessment <em>of</em> learning.</p>

    <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
    <p class="txt">Formative assessment is that which is embedded in the teaching&ndash;learning process. Much of it is informal rather than structured and formal. It has the following features:</p>
    <ul class="bl">
      <li class="li_text">It consists of ongoing strategies such as questions, quizzes, and observation of student performances and products.</li>
      <li class="li_text">It involves providing frequent and timely feedback aimed directly at improving teaching and learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <figure class="photo-portrait">
        <figcaption>
      
            <p class="caption">Cognitive strategies take a variety of forms. Using fingers is a clever and effective <em>cognitive</em> strategy.</p>

      </figure>

    <p class="key-point">Instead of summarizing achievement with a number or grade (summative assessment), formative assessment provides information that a teacher and learner can put to use before formal grading occurs.</p>
    <h3 class="h3">Key to Assessment in Schools</h3>
    <p class="txt">As Hattie (2012) puts it, &quot;The primary function of assessment is to support learning by generating feedback that students can act upon in terms of where they are going, how they are going there, and where they might go next&quot; (p. 126).  </p>
<p class="key-point">Hence, the primary purpose of assessment in schools is (or should be) formative.</p>    
  </div>
  <div class="page_body-bg1">
    <h2 class="h2">Placement Assessment</h2>
    <p class="key-point">As the name implies, <strong>placement assessment</strong> is designed to provide information relating to a learner&#39;s placement.</p>

    <p class="txt">It typically occurs prior to an instructional sequence and looks at the learner&#39;s readiness for a lesson, unit, course, or entire program. </p>

    <p class="txt">Placement assessment often includes <strong>diagnostic assessment</strong>, which is directed specifically at identifying learning strengths or problems and their underlying causes. For example, diagnostic assessment might be used to determine whether a learner would benefit from being placed in a group that receives remedial instruction in reading or mathematics. </p>

     <p class="txt">Of course, the fact that both learners and educational emphases are changing does not mean that all teachers stress the formative role of assessment over its summative uses. Some critics point out that many of today&#39;s schools still reflect the approaches and emphases of the past. Groshell (2017), for example, notes that although there have been enormous advances in both technology and educational goals, relatively little has changed regarding how schools view learning and how they design the learning environment. Still, there is little doubt that the uses and purposes of educational assessment are changing&mdash;and even less doubt that they should.</p>    
  </div>
  <div class="page_body-bg2">
    <h2 class="h2">Performance-Based Assessment</h2>
    <p class="txt">Another important category of educational assessment is <strong>performance-based assessment</strong>. </p>

    <p class="key-point">Performance-based assessments ask learners to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and understanding by actually performing a task or producing a product that directly illustrates what is being assessed. </p>

  <p class="txt">Thus, performance-based assessments can be used for both formative and summative purposes. </p>

    <p class="txt">For example, asking first grader William to read aloud from one of the work sheets that accompanies the <em>Beginning Reader</em> series is a performance-based assessment. Judging William&#39;s performance according to a <strong>rubric</strong>, a type of scoring guide described in Chapter 7 and shown in Table 1.1, provides a basis for using the descriptor <em>Meets Standard</em> on his electronic report card. This would be an example of using performance assessment for <em>summative</em> purposes.</p> 
    
    <p class="txt">If, in the course of observing and assessing William&#39;s reading performance, his teacher notes that he consistently confuses the letters <em>b</em> and <em>d</em>&mdash;a common error&mdash;she can use this information to adjust her instructional approach and provide William with additional help. This illustrates how performance-based assessment can be used for <em>formative</em> purposes.</p>    
  </div>
  <div class="page_body-bg1">
    <h2 class="h2">Bringing It All Together</h2>
    <p class="txt">To summarize: As Figure 1.1 illustrates, assessment might occur before instruction and could be the basis for decisions regarding a learner&#39;s placement (placement assessment). Placement assessment might also involve <em>diagnostic assessment</em>, the main purpose of which is to identify a learner&#39;s strengths and weaknesses, diagnose learning problems, and even uncover the reasons for them.]</p>

   
    <p class="txt">Assessment that occurs during instruction is <em>formative</em> to the extent that it provides feedback to assist in the learning process. Formative assessment is an integral part of the teaching&ndash;learning process, rather than something that occurs only before or after instruction. Assessment that occurs after instruction is usually <em>summative</em>: Its purpose is to summarize learner progress and achievement. Formative assessment is further discussed in Chapter 5; summative assessment is detailed in Chapter 6; and performance-based assessment is the subject of Chapter 7.</p>

<h1 class="h1" id="test1-3">1.3 The Curriculum Planning-Teaching-Assessing Cycle</h1>

<div class="page_lead">
    <p class="intro">To make the best possible use of all forms of educational assessment, three fundamentally important points need to be kept in mind.</p>
  
</div>

<div class="page_body-bg1">
	  <ol class="nl">
        <li class="li_text">Assessment is an integral part of the teaching&ndash;learning process.</li>
        <li class="li_text">Assessment is not simply something that teachers do to students; it is something that is accomplished collaboratively by learners and teachers.</li>
        <li class="li_text">The most important purpose of educational assessment is to enhance student motivation and learning and improve instructional approaches.</li>
        </ol>

        <p class="key-point">Note that although assessing, planning, and teaching are shown as distinct activities, they constantly overlap. </p>

        <p class="txt">Assessment occurs before, during, and after teaching. Planning and modifying approaches to instruction and to learning&mdash;all of which rely on good assessment&mdash;are continuous, ongoing processes. </p>
        
        <p class="txt">The most useful assessments for instructional purposes are informal and frequent ungraded assessments that inform both the teacher&#39;s and the students&#39; minute-to-minute and day-to-day activities.</p>        
      

</div>


<div class="page_body-bg2">
  <h2 class="h2">Some Definitions</h2>
  <p class="txt">Many of the commonly used terms in assessment literature&mdash;terms like <em>test</em>, <em>assessment</em>, <em>mea</em><em>surement</em>, and <em>evaluation</em>&mdash;are treated as though they are synonymous. They aren&#39;t. Table 1.2 briefly summarizes the differences.</p>
