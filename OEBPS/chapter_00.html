        <p class="txt">People, too, sometimes give the wrong answers on tests because they get nervous and scared.
          That&#39;s what often happened to Jacob. Tests scared the pants off him. When he sat down to take one, he
          would quickly forget every sensible thought and well-memorized fact he had stuffed into his brain. His test
          results were a disaster. They greatly chagrined his mother&mdash;especially when, following a series of
          countywide achievement tests, the principal called her in.</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;Jacob should probably stop dreaming about going to university and becoming a
          professor,&quot; said the principal. &quot;There&#39;s other stuff he can do.&quot;</p>
        <p class="txt">But Jacob didn&#39;t stop dreaming. He just kept trying to educate himself. &quot;They
          can&#39;t teach me more stuff just by giving me more tests,&quot; he declared. &quot;That&#39;s about as
          sensible as thinking you can make yourself thinner just by weighing yourself a lot.&quot;</p>

          about?</span></h2>

    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Jacob was a bright young man (his uncle once described him as having a brain as big as a planet).
        But he suffered from what psychologists label <strong>test anxiety</strong>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">The mere thought of any sort of assessment, and the fear that he would not do well, invariably
          led to a frayed emotional state that interfered with Jacob&#39;s ability to perform well on tests. As he
          explained it, school assessments made him feel like a cat that is falling with its back to the ground and just
          can&#39;t seem to get its feet pointed the right way.</p>
        <p class="txt">Assessment can be like that for some students&mdash;highly threatening and anxiety provoking.
          This is especially the case when the student&#39;s performance has profound implications, not only for the
          learner but perhaps also for the teacher, the school, the parents, and others. Such situations are labeled
          <strong>high-stakes testing</strong> environments (these are discussed more in Chapter 10).</p>
        <p class="txt">But assessment in many of today&#39;s schools is very different from what it was in Jacob&#39;s
          school, which at the time was more focused on performance. </p>
        <p class="key-point">In fact, the best current approaches to classroom assessment are designed less to determine
          how well or how poorly students perform and more to help them learn.</p>
        <p class="txt">Such approaches to testing might well have uncovered Jacob&#39;s problem and helped him before he
          abandoned all hope.</p>
        <p class="txt">This chapter looks at current approaches to educational assessment and its various purposes and
          forms. It explains how assessment is driven by the main, overriding goals of the educational enterprise, how
          curricula are designed around these goals, and how assessments are used to gauge the extent to which goals are
          being met. It looks at the implications of various pieces of legislation that direct and influence educational
          endeavors. It examines some of the rules and regulations designed to ensure that assessments are as fair,
          useful, and ethical as possible. Finally, it looks at what we know about approaches that work in education.

      <h1 class="h1"><span class="sec_number">1.2</span> <span class="sec_title">Purposes and Types of Assessment</span>
      </h1>

          purposes of educational assessment? How are summative, formative, and placement assessments different?</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Educational assessment has two broad purposes: The most important, strongly reflected in
        today&#39;s assessment literature, is to improve teaching and learning (e.g., Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2017).
        That purpose is emphasized throughout this text. The second purpose is to measure student achievement in order
        to provide a grade.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <h2 class="h2">Summative Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">Assessment that is mainly used to provide a midterm or year-end grade, or to assess mastery
          at the end of a unit, is called <strong>summative assessment</strong>.</p>
        <p class="txt">Summative assessment has traditionally been the main function of testing in schools, partly
          because its historical emphasis has been on sorting learners to select those with the highest probability of
          future success. Selecting students is no longer the principal mission of our schools, as Stiggins and Chappuis
          (2017) explain.</p>
        <p class="key-point">Schools increasingly need to ensure that learners know how to learn&mdash;that they become
          competent, self-directed learners who are actively involved in their own education.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="text_container">
        <h4><button class="ec_expand" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ecbox1-1">LEARN MORE</button></h4>
        <div id="ecbox1-1">
          <div class="single-column">

            <p class="tx">Yesterday&#39;s approaches to education do not work well for schools&#39; new mission or for
              today&#39;s students, argues Prensky (2011, 2012a, 2012b).</p>
            <p class="tx">Today&#39;s learners are very different: They are members of what is sometimes labeled the
              <strong>net generation</strong> (Oblinger &amp; Oblinger, 2005), also called <em>Generation Z</em>,
              <em>iGen</em>, <em>post-millennials</em>, or a variety of other terms. These learners are so profoundly
              influenced by digital technologies (such as the Internet, video games, and computers) that they think and
              learn differently than did older generations of students. (We look at some characteristics of today&#39;s
              learners and at how these impact learning and assessment in Chapter 3).</p>
            <p class="tx">Because today&#39;s learners are different, and because what we expect of our schools is also
              different, contemporary emphases in education are changing. They reflect our beliefs and intentions
              regarding the main purpose of school. Today&#39;s model is more egalitarian: It advocates success for all
              rather than for a chosen few. Furthermore, educators such as Prensky (2016) strongly argue that education
              should focus less on improving individuals and more on improving the world. In his words, &quot;Kids now
              need an education that is far more connected and real than in the past&mdash;an education that gives them
              not only knowledge, but also provides them with empowerment and agency&quot; (Prensky, 2016, p. 1). </p>
            <p class="tx">Accordingly, today&#39;s teacher views assessment mainly as a tool to provide guidance and
              assistance; to make today&#39;s student a highly competent, self-motivated, lifelong learner. The hope is
              that this learner will also be imbued with the motivation and passion to make the world a better place.

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Assessment designed to improve the teaching/learning process is called <strong>formative
              assessment</strong>. It consists of the huge variety of methods teachers use to assess and assist learner
            progress and comprehension during a lesson, course, or unit. </p>
          <p class="key-point">Put another way, formative assessment is assessment <em>for</em> learning; summative
            assessment is assessment <em>of</em> learning.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
          <p class="txt">Formative assessment is that which is embedded in the teaching&ndash;learning process. Much of
            it is informal rather than structured and formal. It has the following features:</p>
          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">It consists of ongoing strategies such as questions, quizzes, and observation of student
              performances and products.</li>
            <li class="li_text">It involves providing frequent and timely feedback aimed directly at improving teaching
              and learning.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="key-point">Instead of summarizing achievement with a number or grade (summative assessment),
            formative assessment provides information that a teacher and learner can put to use before formal grading
            occurs.</p>
          <h3 class="h3">Key to Assessment in Schools</h3>
          <p class="txt">As Hattie (2012) puts it, &quot;The primary function of assessment is to support learning by
            generating feedback that students can act upon in terms of where they are going, how they are going there,
            and where they might go next&quot; (p. 126). </p>
          <p class="key-point">Hence, the primary purpose of assessment in schools is (or should be) formative.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 class="h2">Placement Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">As the name implies, <strong>placement assessment</strong> is designed to provide
          information relating to a learner&#39;s placement.</p>

        <p class="txt">It typically occurs prior to an instructional sequence and looks at the learner&#39;s readiness
          for a lesson, unit, course, or entire program. </p>

        <p class="txt">Placement assessment often includes <strong>diagnostic assessment</strong>, which is directed
          specifically at identifying learning strengths or problems and their underlying causes. For example,
          diagnostic assessment might be used to determine whether a learner would benefit from being placed in a group
          that receives remedial instruction in reading or mathematics. </p>

        <p class="txt">Of course, the fact that both learners and educational emphases are changing does not mean that
          all teachers stress the formative role of assessment over its summative uses. Some critics point out that many
          of today&#39;s schools still reflect the approaches and emphases of the past. Groshell (2017), for example,
          notes that although there have been enormous advances in both technology and educational goals, relatively
          little has changed regarding how schools view learning and how they design the learning environment. Still,
          there is little doubt that the uses and purposes of educational assessment are changing&mdash;and even less
          doubt that they should.</p>
      </div>

      <a id="p5"></a>
      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Performance-Based Assessment</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Another important category of educational assessment is <strong>performance-based
              assessment</strong>. </p>

          <p class="key-point">Performance-based assessments ask learners to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and
            understanding by actually performing a task or producing a product that directly illustrates what is being
            assessed. </p>

          <p class="txt">Thus, performance-based assessments can be used for both formative and summative purposes. </p>

          <p class="txt">For example, asking first grader William to read aloud from one of the work sheets that
            accompanies the <em>Beginning Reader</em> series is a performance-based assessment. Judging William&#39;s
            performance according to a <strong>rubric</strong>, a type of scoring guide described in Chapter 7 and shown
            in Table 1.1, provides a basis for using the descriptor <em>Meets Standard</em> on his electronic report
            card. This would be an example of using performance assessment for <em>summative</em> purposes.</p>

      <h2 class="h2"> Bringing It All Together </h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">To summarize: As Figure 1.1 illustrates, assessment might occur before instruction and could be
          the basis for decisions regarding a learner&#39;s placement (placement assessment). Placement assessment might
          also involve <em>diagnostic assessment</em>, the main purpose of which is to identify a learner&#39;s
          strengths and weaknesses, diagnose learning problems, and even uncover the reasons for them.]</p>

        <a id="p6"></a>
        <p class="txt">Assessment that occurs during instruction is <em>formative</em> to the extent that it provides
          feedback to assist in the learning process. Formative assessment is an integral part of the
          teaching&ndash;learning process, rather than something that occurs only before or after instruction.
          Assessment that occurs after instruction is usually <em>summative</em>: Its purpose is to summarize learner
          progress and achievement. Formative assessment is further discussed in Chapter 5; summative assessment is
          detailed in Chapter 6; and performance-based assessment is the subject of Chapter 7.</p>

              assessment procedure might seem mainly summative, formative, or intended for placement decisions, the
              overriding purpose of educational assessment is to improve student learning.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="single-column">
          <h3 class="h3">Test</h3>

          <p class="key-point">In education, the word <strong>test</strong> typically refers to specific instruments or
            procedures designed to measure student achievement or progress, or to identify various student
            characteristics. </p>

          <p class="txt"><strong>Tests</strong> typically consist of a sample of behaviors (responses) that serve as a
            basis for making inferences. For example, a ninth-grade algebra final test does not examine students&#39;
            complete body of algebraic knowledge or their ability to solve all problems related to the entire course.
            Instead, the test consists of a representative sample of problems. If a student responds correctly to 84% of
            the problems, the examiner infers that the student also would have responded correctly to 84% of the entire
            pool of relevant problems. </p>

          <p class="txt">Test results are often <em>quantitative</em> in that they provide a numerical measure, such as
            90%, or a grade with clear meaning, such as a B. However, sometimes they are <em>qualitative</em>, in that
            they describe some particular quality such as <em>Meeting all standards</em> or <em>Excellent descriptive
            </em><em>paragraph</em>. Whether tests are developed by the teacher or are commercially prepared, they are a
            relatively formal approach to assessment. They are commonly used in placement and summative assessment but
            less so in formative assessment, which tends to be more informal.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Measurement</h3>

          <p class="txt">Measurements are usually quantitative: They are used to indicate an amount. Thus, I
            <em>measure</em> the length of my foot in inches or centimeters; but I can <em>test</em> its suitability for
            running by putting it through a series of movements. </p>

          <p class="key-point"><strong>Measurement </strong>in education is usually based on the results of tests.
            Strictly speaking, educational measurement is a set of procedures for manipulating and interpreting test
            results. </p>

          <p class="txt">For example, educational measurement might involve making decisions about specific levels of
            performance that are acceptable in a unit test or that identify learners who need assistance.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Assessment</h3>

          <p class="txt"><em>Assessment</em> is a more general term. </p>

          <a id="p9"></a>
          <p class="key-point">In an educational setting, <strong>assessment</strong> refers to all the
            activities&mdash;including testing and measuring&mdash;undertaken by a teacher to obtain information about
            students&#39; characteristics, their progress and achievement, and the effectiveness of instructional
            methods in relation to desired outcomes. </p>

          <p class="txt">There is a strong belief that in the 21st century, assessment should be a collaborative process
            that engages both learner and teacher, and perhaps involves parents as well. In this sense, assessment
            reflects a commitment to achievement and progress, and recognizes that assessment-based feedback is an
            essential component of the teaching&ndash;learning cycle. </p>

          <p class="txt">Educational assessment is no longer viewed as a mysterious, secretive, teacher-controlled
            process. Today&#39;s learner should be able to access assessment-based, formative feedback in collaboration
            with the teacher&mdash;perhaps by means of face-to-face interactions or via online, digital technology.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Evaluation</h3>

          <p class="txt">Literally, <em>evaluation</em> refers to the process of making a value judgment. It may involve
            deciding that something is good or bad, moral or immoral, effective or ineffective. </p>

          <p class="txt">In education, however, evaluation is seldom as subjective as this definition might imply.</p>

          <p class="key-point"><strong>Evaluation </strong>is usually based on the results of one or more assessments,
            and it often takes the form of an appraisal based on whether certain criteria have been met. </p>

          <p class="txt">For example, determining whether a student qualifies for special needs services in primary
            grades usually requires the use of specific evaluation criteria related to speech and language difficulties,
            social and emotional problems, or behavioral problems.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Grade</h3>

          <p class="key-point"><strong>Grades</strong> are generally numbers, letters, or verbal descriptors that
            describe a particular rank or quality. </p>

          <p class="txt">Thus, there are different grades of beef, lumber, wheat, paper&mdash;and even students. </p>

          <p class="key-point">In education, grades are summative rather than formative. </p>

          <p class="txt">They are usually based on the results of tests or on other forms of assessment. Occasionally,
            as we will see in Chapter 11, they might also reflect other factors such as performance on assignments or
            class participation. </p>

      <h2 class="h2"> What We Measure</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Assessments, measurements, and evaluations are a huge part of everyday life. You have been

        <p class="key-point">In many ways, life is a series of formal and informal assessments.</p>

        <p class="txt">Some show how well you are performing compared to your peers; others appraise your performance
          relative to some standard or norm that describes expected or average behavior or achievement. </p>

        <p class="txt">And of course, the preschool and school experiences that follow bring with them a whole range of
          new assessments. At the very least, schools typically measure student achievement; most also assess various
          kinds of aptitude or ability. They might also examine personality, vocational and career interests, and
          performance in different subject areas. </p>

        <a id="p11"></a>

        <p class="txt">Some of the assessments used involve formal measuring instruments, often produced by professional
          test developers. Others are constructed by teachers. </p>

        <p class="txt">Often, too, assessment is based on more informal kinds of observations made both in and outside

        <h2 class="h2">How We Use Results</h2>

        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">The chief purpose of any educational assessment is to foster learning. However, each of the
            broad assessment approaches described in Table 1.4 might serve a variety of purposes in the classroom,
            including the following.</p>
          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">determining whether learning goals are being met</li>
            <li class="li_text">assessing the effectiveness of instructional methods</li>
            <li class="li_text">gauging the extent to which learners are engaged in learning</li>
            <li class="li_text">monitoring student achievement</li>
            <li class="li_text">providing information for parents</li>
            <li class="li_text">satisfying administrative and judicial requirements</li>
            <li class="li_text">appraising learner satisfaction and happiness</li>

      <h2 class="h2"> What Information Learners Need</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Most of the uses for educational assessment are not mutually exclusive. A single,
          well-constructed, teacher-made, end-of-unit test might serve every one of the purposes just listed. </p>

        <p class="key-point">However, the kind of assessment information the learner needs is quite different from the
          assessment information that might be given to parents.</p>

        <p class="txt">Interested parties such as parents, prospective employers, and university admissions officers are
          mainly interested in summative information that allows them to compare and evaluate. That is, they want to
          know what the learner has achieved relative to educational goals and relative to other learners. On that
          basis, they can predict what the learner is capable of, provide advice about educational and career options,
          and make decisions about placement.</p>

        <p class="key-point">In contrast, what learners need in the day-to-day business of learning is immediate,
          personalized, confidential information about their learning. They need formative information that will enhance
          their ongoing development. </p>
