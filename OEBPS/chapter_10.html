    <p class="quote_text">The normal curve is a distribution most appropriate to chance and random activity. Education is a purpose-ful activity and we seek to have students learn what we would teach. Therefore, if we are effective, the distribu-tion of grades will be anything but a normal curve. In fact, a normal curve is evidence of our failure to teach.</p>

  <div class="co_intro">
    <div class="co_text">
        <p class="txt">My friend, Scot Gardiner, a highly respected professor at a well-known Eastern university, would have agreed wholeheartedly with Benjamin Bloom: He, too, had a strong aversion to the normal curve.</p>
        <p class="txt">Scot was invited to give a course at our university one winter. He was assigned to teach learning theories to a graduate class containing slightly more than a dozen students.</p>
        <p class="txt">There is little doubt that Scot was a gifted lecturer and teacher. The students loved his course. They attended eagerly and worked hard on their written assignments. And at the end of the course, every one of them was rewarded with the highest possible grade: a 9 on a 9-point grading system. Scot went back to his home university, cherished by his students and happy with his visit to our university.</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;But he can&#39;t do that, your friend,&quot; the department chair informed me. &quot;Call him and tell him he has to change those grades. There&#39;s no distribution, for heaven&#39;s sake!&quot;</p>
        <p class="txt">So I called Scot. &quot;They want you to change your grades,&quot; I said.</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;Why?&quot;</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;They&#39;re too high. The chairman says they have to be closer to the normal curve.&quot;</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;But those aren&#39;t normal students,&quot; Scot insisted. &quot;They&#39;re exceptionally bright, graduate students! They&#39;re all at the very top end of that dang curve!&quot;</p>
		<p class="txt">Scot refused to change a single grade. So the administration changed them, threw them around a small curve so that most students got 7s and 8s, only one or two got a 9, and an unlucky two were saddled with 6s. And Scot was never invited to teach here again.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What are standardized tests? What are the main uses and limitations of standardized tests?</span></h2>
  </div>
      <div class="section-lead">
         <p class="intro">The <em>normal curve</em>, as we saw in Chapter 9, is a remarkable mathematical (and graphical) description of the distribution of a large number of random or near-random events. It describes exceptionally well what happens when you place, say, 100 coins in your ball cap, shake them, spill them onto your desk, and then count and record how many come up heads and how many tails.</p>
     </div>

  <div class="section-body">
      
     
	  <div class="single-column">    
	         <p class="txt">Do this 5,000 times, and you will find that the most common distribution is right around 50 heads and 50 tails, with fewer and fewer cases as you move away from that center. But occasionally, you&#39;ll throw far more heads than tails&mdash;or more tails than heads. Both extremes tend to balance out because the outcome of tossing coins is a chance event.</p>
			 <p class="txt">However, the outcome on a test, as Bloom, points out, is not a chance event: Among other things, it reflects the effectiveness of the teacher and the dedication, motivation, intelligence, and persistence of the learners. And if, as in Scot&#39;s case, the teacher is exceptionally effective and the learners are highly intelligent, intensely motivated, and historically high achieving, the result of any assessment procedure should not resemble the &quot;normal&quot; curve that would result from assessing a more varied sample.</p>
<a id="p391"></a>
			 <p class="txt">Still, as the chairman insisted, there will nevertheless be variation within the most highly selected groups. And within these groups, there may well be a distribution of results similar to a normal curve&mdash;only the mean will be much higher, and the variability much lower, than would be found among other samples.</p>
      </div>


   <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">What Is a Standardized Test?</h2>
	    <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Although the normal curve might not be especially useful for small and highly select samples (such as Scot&#39;s graduate class), it describes very well how large populations perform on what are called <em>standardized tests</em>. A standardized test is a test that is administered and scored in a consistent manner. Most standardized tests are commercially produced tests prepared by groups of professionals. These tests are usually refined and improved over time after being administered to large numbers of participants. As a result, they typically reflect the performance of samples that are highly representative of the populations from which they are drawn.</p>
          <p class="txt">Almost all standardized tests that are of interest to educators have been prepared for nationwide or statewide use. When a standardized test is administered to a representative population of test takers&mdash;that is, to a norming group&mdash;it can provide <strong>norms</strong>&mdash;bases of comparison like means and standard deviations. </p>
          <p class="key-point">As a result, standardized tests are a valuable tool for comparing the performance of a student, or a group of students, to nationwide or statewide standards.</p>
          <p class="txt">The main differences between commercially prepared standardized and most teacher-made tests are described in Table 10.1. Note that the first nine points tend to favor standardized achievement tests over teacher-constructed tests. The last point, however, highlights some of the limitations and criticisms of standardized testing. We note these again in the discussion of high-stakes testing.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">A Brief History of Standardized Tests</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
            <p class="txt">Suppose that in 1920 your college had space to admit only one more student. The choice has been narrowed to two people: Either Robert or Rosa will be accepted, but not both. So you look at their academic records and at their letters of recommendation. Robert, who went to a small public high school, achieved an average year-end grade of 88%. His teachers are unanimous in their praise of his intelligence, motivation, ambition, and persistence. And Rosa, who went to a private college preparatory school, graduated summa cum laude with a final letter grade of A. Her teachers agree wholeheartedly that her ability, drive, aspirations, and determination are unequalled.</p>
          <p class="txt">There was simply no easy way in 1920 to decide objectively which of the two candidates was most worthy. But in 1923 Carl Brigham published a highly influential&mdash;and controversial&mdash;book entitled <em>A Study of American Intelligence</em>. Among other things, this book described the <strong>Army Tests</strong>, the first intelligence tests to be administered to huge numbers of people&mdash;more than 2 million army recruits. </p>

          <p class="txt">These early <em>Army</em> tests soon led to the <strong>Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT)</strong>&mdash;also referred to as the <em>College Boards</em>&mdash;first published in 1926. The SAT has since been revised and renormed many times. It is now known as the SAT Suite of Assessments (College Board, 2018).</p>

          <p class="caption">In World War I the U.S. Amy provided a huge sample of subjects for the standardization of the first group intelligence tests&mdash;developed by Carl Brigham and called simply the Army Tests.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

        <div class="single-column">
	      <p class="txt">Standardized tests such as the SAT quickly became popular, largely because of the unreliability of many teacher-constructed tests. Without standardization of testing&mdash;and of grading&mdash;there is no dependable way to compare evaluations provided by different schools. This presents a serious problem for committees that make college admission decisions, entities that grant scholarships, armed forces recruiters, potential employers, and many others. </p>
          <p class="txt">The SAT is one of two basic kinds of standardized tests that are widely used in educational assessment: <em>aptitude tests</em> and <em>standardized achievement tests</em>. </p>
          <p class="txt">An <strong>aptitude test</strong> is a test that measures a person&#39;s ability or skill. <strong>Intelligence tests (IQ tests)</strong> are widely considered to be a form of aptitude test, although the terms <em>aptitude</em> and <em>intelligence</em> mean slightly different things. <strong>Aptitude</strong> refers to a specific skill or ability (or the capacity to acquire a specific skill or ability). For example, a student might have high mathematical aptitude or high mechanical aptitude. <strong>Intelligence</strong>, on the other hand, is defined as a more general capacity to learn, to adapt, and to profit from experience. </p>
          <p class="txt">Unlike aptitude tests, <strong>standardized achievement tests</strong> are designed to measure <em>acquired</em> learning rather than <em>potential</em> for learning. Simply put, they look at achievement. They are typically designed to measure grade-specific knowledge in different subject areas. A single standardized achievement test might yield a variety of scores relating to subjects such as mathematics, reading, science, and social studies. (We look at examples of standardized aptitude and achievement tests in a later section of this chapter.) </p>

<div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Purpose of Standardized Tests</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
            <p class="txt">One important purpose of standardized tests is to compare the performance of a test taker to the average performance of a group made up of comparable people&mdash;namely, the group on which the test was standardized. </p>
            <p class="txt">A second related purpose is to compare the performance of a class, school, or larger educational unit to national achievement standards for similar age and grade groups. </p>
  
     </div>

        <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">Tomwang112/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
          <p class="caption">Standardized tests are often administered to large groups at one time, as shown here. The performance of the entire group, and of each student, can then be compared to state and national standards. Results might be used for placement decisions, to certify achievement, and as evidence of school and teacher accountability.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

   <div class="single-column"> 
       	           <p class="txt">Schools and teachers use standardized tests for several different purposes. </p>
        	<ul class="bl">
        	        <li class="li_text">For placement in programs for learners with special needs. Intelligence tests, a common form of standardized aptitude test, are widely used for this purpose. So, too, are diagnostic tests that are designed to identify learners with specific learning disabilities.</li>
        	        <li class="li_text">To certify students&#39; achievement. Minimum competency tests, which are used to determine whether an individual has the minimum qualifications required for placement, admission, or employment, illustrate this use. The use of standardized entrance examinations to decide whether to accept an applicant for a course of study is another example, as is the use of such tests to determine success or failure following a course.</li>
        	        <li class="li_text">As evidence of school and teacher accountability. Legislation such as ESSA requires that assessments be used both to monitor student achievement with respect to statewide standards and to ensure increased teacher and school accountability. In effect, standardized tests can be used to evaluate schools (through the performance of students). This is an example of <em>high-stakes testing</em>, about which we will say more later in this chapter.</li>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are age- and grade-equivalent scores?</span></h2>
  </div>
   <div class="section-lead">
       <p class="intro">Because standardized tests are normed by being administered to large, representative samples, test makers have reason to assume that the scores will conform to the normal curve. As a result, the original scores are often converted to conform to that curve. </p>     
  </div>
<a id="p395"></a>
<div class="section-body">
       <div class="single-column">        
          <p class="txt">When a teacher administers a standardized achievement test, the actual score on the test (the raw score) is often meaningless until it is changed to a <strong>converted score</strong> (also called a <strong>scaled score</strong>). A scaled (or converted) score is created when a candidate&#39;s raw score is transformed to conform to a distribution with predetermined characteristics. Many test production companies scale (mathematically transform) raw scores from the various tests they produce, so that all the raw scores have the same distribution. For example, raw scores on the two main sections of the SAT tests&mdash;the math section and the EBRW (Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section)&mdash;are scaled so that the maximum score on each is 800 and the minimum is 200. Combined, the maximum score is 1600. The 50th percentile (the point above and below which 50 percent of all scores fall) is 1080; 1200 is at the 75th percentile, and 1340 is at the 90th percentile (College Board, 2017). Note that being at the 90th percentile does not mean that the student answered 90% of the items correctly; it simply means that the student scored at a level equal to or higher than 90% of test takers.</p>
          <p class="txt">The use of scaled scores allows direct comparisons between different tests or between different forms of the same test, not all of which are of equal difficulty. Converting a raw score to a scaled score (using a simple conversion table) compensates for differences in the difficulty of the items that make up different tests. Scaled scores can subsequently be converted to percentiles that indicate the percentage of examinees who scored below a given point. Converting raw scores to scaled scores and to percentiles is done simply by reading corresponding numbers off a chart. An example of a simple conversion chart is shown in Table 10.2.</p>

          <p class="txt">The converted score that is derived from the norming tables for a test reflects <em>test norms</em> for that test. <strong>Test norms</strong> are simply statistical descriptions of the performance of the group on which the test was standardized (the norming group). As a result, norms describe expected or normal performance relative to the norming group.</p>
          <p class="txt">Test norms can take a variety of forms. The example shown in Table 10.2 converts raw scores to percentiles. Other commonly used norms include <em>age-equivalent scores</em> and <em>grade-equivalent scores</em>. Norms can also be expressed as normal curve equivalents, the most common of which are <em>Z-scores, T-scores</em>, or <em>stanines</em>. </p>
          <p class="txt"><strong>Age-equiavalent scores</strong> and <strong>grade-equivalent scores</strong>, as the terms imply, simply convert raw scores to an age or grade corresponding to the average performance of the test takers who made up the norming group. Unfortunately, they are often misunderstood both by parents and by teachers.</p>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Grade-Equivalent Scores</h2>
          <div class="single-column">     
           <p class="txt">As an example, converting Kaya&#39;s raw score on a standardized mathematics achievement test for fourth grade might indicate that she is performing at a level equivalent to 7.4&mdash;meaning that her mathematics grade-equivalent score on this test is equivalent to performance at month 4 of grade 7. Does this mean that she really shouldn&#39;t be in fourth-grade mathematics at all? That she should really be doing work smack in the middle of seventh grade?</p>
           <p class="key-point">The answer is no. Grade-equivalent scores are not as simple as they seem, for two reasons: First, because of the way most standardized achievement tests are developed and normed, very likely no seventh graders took the test. </p>
           <p class="txt">Commercial achievement test preparers developing a mathematics achievement test for fourth grade typically produce and administer a collection of appropriate items to a sample of fourth-grade students, and perhaps to some third- and fifth-grade students as well. Then they compute the average performance of fourth graders at different times during the year and provide tables that indicate which raw score corresponds to what grade. Grade equivalents are usually expressed as an integer to indicate a grade level, followed by a decimal and another integer that indicates the month of the school year. Thus, a grade equivalent of 4.5 would correspond to the average performance of the norming group in month 5 of grade 4.</p>
           <p class="key-point">Next, test makers <span class="txt_bold">extrapolate</span> a range of grade equivalents so that very high or very low scores sometimes go well beyond the grades that actually took the test. </p>
           <p class="txt">As a result, a very high raw score such as that obtained by Kaya is normed as being equivalent to grade 7.4. But, as noted earlier, no seventh graders took the test. And the test does not contain items similar to what might be on a test designed for seventh graders. If Kaya were to take a seventh-grade mathematics achievement test, it is quite possible that her raw score would convert to an embarrassingly low grade equivalent.</p>
           <p class="txt">The second reason for not interpreting grade-equivalent scores too literally is that a grade norm typically reflects the average performance of students at a given point in a grade. But we know that average performance simply describes the approximate center of a distribution of performances. Approximately half the norming group will have scored below the average, and half above it. So, although parents and teachers might be dismayed at a grade-equivalent score that is somewhat below the student&#39;s actual grade, in most cases they should interpret that outcome with caution. It is unlikely that being some months, or even a year, behind an expected norm puts Mateo beyond a normal range of variability in mathematics achievement. Nor would scoring 6 months ahead of the average for his norming group warrant that he be accelerated and enriched so that he might eventually be placed with the gifted and talented.</p>
		  </div>
     </div>



  <h2 class="h2">Age-Equivalent Scores</h2>
  <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Age equivalents are used when norming tables convert raw scores to ages rather than grades. For example, an age-equivalent score might indicate that 6-year-old Sofia is reading at an age level of 10.2. Again, this does not mean that Sofia has the same vocabulary and reading skills as the average 10.2-year-old. It&#39;s likely that no 10-year-olds actually took the test, so we do not know how they might have fared on what would be, for most of them, a very easy test. And if Sofia were to take a standardized achievement reading test designed specifically for 10-year-olds, she might well fall off the bottom of the norming scale, no matter how clever she now seems.</p>
 <a id="p397"></a>
		  <p class="key-point">One important limitation of age- and grade-equivalent scores is that the differences between scores are not equal across all age and grade levels. </p>
          <p class="txt">For example, reading at a second-grade level when you are in first grade is probably far more significant than reading at an 11th-grade level when you are in 10th grade. That is because many more new reading skills and competencies develop in the earlier years than in the later&nbsp;grades. </p>
          <p class="txt">In much the same way, mathematics competencies tend to develop unevenly, so that differences between some grades are more meaningful than between others. For this reason, some standardized achievement test publishers no longer provide age and grade equivalents in their norming tables.</p>

  </div>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Percentile Ranks</h2>
          <div class="single-column">     
         <p class="txt">Percentile ranks are another way to describe a student&#39;s performance on a standardized test. As we saw in Chapter 9, percentiles indicate the percentage of scores that fall at or below a given point. Thus, the 75th percentile is the point at or below which 75% of all observations fall. If a student scores at the 50th percentile on a standardized test, that student&#39;s score is exactly in the middle. Note that a score corresponding to the 40th or the 35th percentile is not a failing score; it is simply the score at or below which 40% or 35% of observations fall.</p>

		  </div>
     </div>

     <h2 class="h2">Conversions Based on the Normal Curve</h2>
        <div class="single-column">     
          <p class="txt">Raw scores are often converted to one of a variety of scores that have clear meaning because they correspond to the normal distribution. As we saw in Chapter 9, the normal distribution (or normal curve) has two important characteristics that make it ideal for norming tests designed for large-scale administration&mdash;as are most commercially prepared standardized&nbsp;tests. </p>

		  	<ol class="nl">
		  		<li class="li_text">It is a remarkably accurate description of many naturally occurring events, so that if you plot a sufficient number of numerical values associated with random, chance happenings, they will eventually reveal a normal distribution. Even nonrandom variables such as test results often conform to a normal distribution if you collect enough of them.</li>
		  		<li class="li_text">Normal distributions have certain mathematical characteristics that allow us to predict where different proportions of scores will lie. All we need to know is where the mathematical center of the distribution is and how scores are spread around its center. Given the mean and the standard deviation of a distribution, we can determine much about the meaning of any student&#39;s score relative to the norming population. With the same information, we can also compare the performance of entire classes&mdash;or even schools or school systems&mdash;to the performances of national or statewide groups.</li>
		  	</ol>
 <a id="p398"></a>
		  <p class="txt">Test makers sometimes provide their own conversions based on the normal curve by using means and standard deviations of their own choosing. Often, however, they use one or more of three common types of converted scores, referred to as <strong>standard scores</strong> (see Figure 10.1).</p>

       <div id="ecbox10-2">
		 <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Z-scores, T-scores, and stanines are all standard scores with a predetermined mean and standard deviation. They are used to simplify interpretation of test results. Because raw scores on different tests vary a great deal, as do means and standard deviations, simply knowing that a person has a score of 112 or 23 or 1,115 is meaningless unless we know what the mean and standard deviation are for a comparable group on that test. Yet if these raw scores are transformed into one of the standard scores, they become highly meaningful.</p>
          <p class="txt"><strong>Z-scores</strong> are standard scores with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1; <strong>T-scores</strong> have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10; and a <strong>stanine</strong> (short for <em>standard nine</em>) score is a nine-point scale with a mean of 5 and a standard deviation of 2. The meanings of these standard scores, relative to each other, are shown in Figure 10.1. As you can see, a T-score of 80 would be an extremely high score (three standard deviations above the mean is at the 99th percentile); the equivalent Z-score would be 3. There is no exactly equivalent stanine score, because the highest score possible on this nine-point scale is 9, which is two standard deviations above the mean.</p>
          <p class="txt">Converting raw test scores to one of these standard-score scales is usually very simple because virtually all tests that use them provide conversion tables. These tables typically allow you to read the standard-score equivalent directly once you know the student&#39;s raw score and age or grade. As long as you know what the mean and standard deviation are for these standard scores, they will be meaningful. Otherwise, they are just numbers.</p>
  <a id="p399"></a>
		  <p class="txt">The fact that standard scores are just numbers unless you know what they mean is one of the limitations of their use. Most parents, and many teachers, don&#39;t know what a stanine of 8, a T-score of 65, or a Z-score of 1.5 mean&mdash;much less that they are roughly equivalent. Most people think they understand percentiles, and even more are convinced they know exactly what an age equivalent and a grade equivalent mean. Unfortunately, as we saw, their knowledge of these last two values may be misleading.</p>

  </div>

  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">Standardized tests are available for almost any purpose imaginable.</p>  
  </div>

<div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">There are national police officer tests; standardized tests for admission into the ranks of accountants, lawyers, and even teachers; statewide exams for getting a driver&#39;s license; federal and state tests for boating licenses; and standardized tests for citizenship. There are mandatory standardized tests that assess a baby&#39;s condition at birth, and there are even standardized procedures for determining if a person is brain dead.</p>
          <p class="txt">Of particular interest in educational assessment, hundreds of different standardized tests have been designed to assess aptitude, achievement, and personality. The term <em>aptitude</em>, as we saw earlier, refers to a specific ability or talent. For example, mathematical aptitude refers to an inherent ability to learn mathematics&mdash;a talent for mathematics. Very closely related to the term <em>aptitude</em> is the term <em>intelligence</em>, which refers not to a specific ability or talent but to far more general abilities. One way of defining intelligence is to say that it is a talent for learning and performing that encompasses a wide variety of areas. </p>
          <p class="txt">Early approaches to understanding intelligence identified a general factor, labeled the <strong><em>g</em> factor</strong> (the <em>g</em> stands for <em>general</em>), which appears to underlie intelligence. In a sense, the <em>g</em> factor accounts for the generally high correlation among different cognitive tasks. What this means is that individuals who do well on one cognitive task are likely to do well on others. This high correlation among the different abilities measured by most intelligence tests is what accounts for the <em>g</em> factor (Eid, Geiser, Koch, &amp; Heene, 2017). IQ scores are sometimes interpreted as being a measure of an individual&#39;s <em>g</em> factor.</p>
          <p class="txt">But that is only one of many approaches to intelligence. We look at several more here.</p>

	  <h2 class="h2">Boring&#39;s Definition of Intelligence</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Intelligence, said Boring (1923) &quot;is what the tests test&quot; (p. 35). In other words, we do not really know how to define intelligence, but we have intelligence tests that correlate relatively highly with success on tasks we think require intelligence&mdash;such as doing well in school. Therefore, even if we cannot agree on what intelligence is, we might agree that we can actually measure it. So, intelligence <em>is</em> what the tests test.</p>
  <a id="p400"></a>
		<p class="txt">Still, this is not an especially productive or useful definition. Definitions and explanations that look at the actual processes, capabilities, and actions involved in intelligent behavior are more practical.</p>
      </div>
</div>

    <h2 class="h2">Cattell: Fluid and Crystallized Abilities</h2>
 	  <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Intelligence, explains Cattell (1971), involves two different kinds of capabilities. </p>
          <p class="txt">On the one hand are abilities that seem to underlie much of our intelligent behavior, termed <strong>fluid abilities</strong>. Fluid abilities are involved in problem solving, representing symbolically, manipulating, organizing, and learning. These abilities are essentially nonverbal and relatively unaffected by culture or experience. They are evident in speed of processing, general reasoning, memory, and attention span. As neurological functioning deteriorates with old age, so too do fluid abilities (McDonough et al., 2016). </p>
          <p class="txt">In Cattell&#39;s second group of abilities are the <strong>crystallized abilities</strong>. These are mostly verbal, and they are heavily influenced by culture, experience, and education. Crystallized abilities are evident in vocabulary tests, tests of general information, and arithmetic skills. Because these abilities depend on the acquisition, storage, and recall of information, they tend to increase with increasing experience. As a result, unlike fluid abilities, crystallized abilities may increase with age, sometimes even into very old age (Yuan, Voelkle, &amp; Raz, 2018). See Table 10.3.</p>

	  <h2 class="h2">Sternberg: Successful Intelligence</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">The most useful approach to understanding intelligence, says Sternberg (1996, 2015b), is to focus on people who are successful in adapting to the world. If we do that, we find that these intelligent people not only learn well, they are also exceptionally skilled at selecting and shaping their environments. These people have <strong>successful intelligence</strong>.</p>
          <p class="key-point">Note how this view emphasizes adaptation. </p>
          <p class="txt">In effect, explains Sternberg, the most intelligent individuals are those who exercise control over their environments by selecting or changing them as well as by modifying their own behavior. Thus, a successfully intelligent student not only selects classes and programs that fit her interests and abilities, but also strives to improve relevant skills and knowledge to maximize her success (her adaptation).</p>
          <p class="txt">Successful intelligence is evident in how well the individual is able to evaluate options, devise strategies for attaining goals, and assess the extent to which goals are being met. In other words, successful intelligence requires analytical abilities. These allow the individual to evaluate options, devise strategies, and monitor progress in adapting. Analytical abilities involve judging, evaluating, contrasting, comparing, and analyzing.</p>
          <p class="txt">Creative abilities are also essential to successful intelligence. These allow the individual to discover options, generate ideas, and try new ways of selecting and shaping the environment and of adapting to it. Creative abilities are apparent in activities such as discovering, imagining, inventing, and supposing.</p>
          <p class="txt">Finally, successful intelligence requires the practical abilities that are necessary for carrying out options. Without a high level of practical abilities, it is difficult to put into practice the behaviors and skills that are involved in selecting, shaping, and adapting to environments. </p>
          <p class="txt">Analytical, creative, and practical skills are the three components of successful intelligence. They make up Sternberg&#39;s <strong>triarchic theory of successful intelligence</strong>. This theory suggests that conventional measures of intelligence might not be as useful as educators had thought. That&#39;s because they seldom measure either creative or practical abilities. Thus, they might provide a very misleading picture of this thing called successful intelligence (see Figure 10.2).</p>

		  <p class="txt">Sternberg&#39;s view of successful intelligence has the advantage of making the concept less abstract; it brings it down to a more concrete and more easily understood level. </p>
          <p class="key-point">Perhaps even more important, it emphasizes that intelligence is not a fixed, unchanging quality that we cannot alter. It echoes the contemporary view that intelligence is highly malleable rather than fixed&mdash;it isn&#39;t something that we have just so much of, and that&#39;s it. </p>

    <h2 class="h2">Gardner&#39;s Multiple Intelligences</h2>
 	  <div class="single-column">
           <p class="txt">Sternberg&#39;s model describes intelligence as an information processing activity&mdash;an activity that requires analyzing, being creative, and putting intentions into practice. This information-processing view contrasts sharply with earlier views that saw intelligence as a mysterious something that some people had a whole lot of and others, not so much.</p>
          <p class="txt">In Sternberg&#39;s view, intelligence is a little like a box filled with the tools we use to play the game of cognition. We might not all have exactly the same tools in our boxes; our genes have seen to that. But we can certainly learn to take better advantage of the ones we have. And we might also benefit from seeing what tools others use and how they use them. Some of us have rusty old tools we have never used. </p>
  <a id="p403"></a>
		  <p class="txt">Ask people how smart they are, says Gardner (Chen &amp; Gardner, 2005), and many will hesitate. They don&#39;t quite know how to answer. &quot;It depends,&quot; they say. Maybe it depends on whether you are asking about how easily they can remember facts and figures or how easily they can solve problems. Or perhaps it depends on whether you are asking them how smart they are compared to their peers or to neurosurgeons and rocket scientists or to a family member.</p>
          <p class="txt">Yet what if instead of asking, &quot;How smart are you?&quot; you ask, &quot;How are you smart?&quot; The answer might be immediate and highly revealing. Now people say, &quot;Hey, I never forget a name or a face,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m a whiz at math, but I&#39;m not so good at reading people,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m a great storyteller but I&#39;m not so hot at writing stuff.&quot;</p>
          <p class="key-point">Gardner&#39;s theory of multiple intelligences says that we have not one but at least eight largely unrelated kinds of intelligence: logical-mathematical, linguistic, musical, spatial, bodily kinesthetic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalistic. </p>
          <p class="txt">Gardner (2006b, 2016) also considered the possibility that we might have additional types of intelligence&mdash;such as moral intelligence, spiritual intelligence, and an aptitude for humor&mdash;but concluded that these traits do not meet the criteria for distinct intelligences, although they might be included in a broad category called <em>existential</em> intelligence (Gardner, 1999). The eight distinct kinds of intelligence are explained in the following interaction. (The interaction replaces Table 10.4 in the PDF version of the book.)</p>

          <p class="txt">We don&#39;t assess multiple intelligences very well, note Chen and Gardner (2005). Most of our intelligence tests tend to focus on mathematical, linguistic, and logical tasks because we&#39;ve assumed that these sorts of tasks are most closely related to intelligent behavior. However, these tasks are unrelated to our kinesthetic, intrapersonal, interpersonal, naturalistic, or musical aptitudes. </p>
  <a id="p404"></a>
		  <p class="key-point">Basically, the Gardner view of multiple intelligences requires the development of a range of new intelligence tests to tap these neglected competencies&mdash;most of which are not easily measured by means of paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests. </p>
          <p class="txt">In addition to its implications for testing intelligence, this highly popular theory has important applications in education. Gardner (2006b) argues that schools need to pay far more attention to what and how they teach. </p>
          <p class="key-point">A guiding principle for approaches to instruction based on the theory of multiple intelligences suggests that children should have each of their intelligences stimulated every day. </p>
          <p class="txt">A well-rounded curriculum would include daily opportunities for every student to participate in music, bodily kinesthetic activities (sports and dance, for example), social activities, and activities requiring spatial skills, as well as a range of more traditional activities involving logical, mathematical, and linguistic skills. </p>
          <p class="txt">Schools, Gardner (2006a) explains, are facing tremendous challenges. They need to be concerned with the kinds of minds people will need if they are to be prepared for the future. In Gardner&#39;s own words from a recent interview:</p>
          <p class="ext">In the future, individuals who succeed will need to have a disciplined mind (knowing how to become an expert in one or more fields), a synthesizing mind (which can put together disparate information in a useful way), a creating mind (raising new questions and solving difficult challenges), a respectful mind (being able to deal well with individuals near and far), and an ethical mind (handling the challenges that arise in the workplace and in one&#39;s role as citizen, where one needs to behave in a moral way). (<em>Sole 24 Ore</em>, 2015)</p>
          <p class="txt">Gardner&#39;s view of multiple intelligences is highly compatible with the contemporary belief that the most useful assessments are those that identify important differences among learners and that provide information (feedback) that serves to enhance each learner&#39;s progress and achievements. That, as we saw in Chapter 5, is what is meant by differentiated assessment and differentiated instruction. Differentiated approaches to learning and instruction are especially important for children with special needs&mdash;a group that includes not only children who experience significant difficulty in learning and ELL students, but also those with remarkable gifts and talents.</p>

	  <h2 class="h2">Dweck&#39;s Mindsets: Entity Versus Incremental Theories of Intelligence</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Some people, Dweck (1986, 1999) informs us, view intelligence as fixed and unchanging&mdash;something that certain people possess a great deal of and others, not so much. These people are said to have an <strong>entity theory</strong> of intelligence; they view ability as an unchanging entity.</p>
  <a id="p405"></a>
		  <p class="txt">Others see intelligence as something that is malleable. They are said to have an <strong>incremental theory</strong> of intelligence; they view it as a thing that can be increased with effort and determination.</p>
          <p class="txt">These two ways of viewing intelligence&mdash;Dweck (2006) calls them <strong>mindsets</strong>&mdash;have tremendously important implications for effort and achievement, both in education and in other endeavors. </p>
          <p class="key-point">Our mindsets regarding intelligence shape our attitudes, goals, efforts, and ultimately, behaviors and achievements. </p>
          <p class="txt">Those who believe that intelligence does not change&mdash;who have a <em>fixed mindset</em>&mdash;often go out of their way to demonstrate that they have a lot of this thing they view as intelligence. As a result, they tend to avoid difficult tasks and challenges that might expose their weaknesses, much preferring undertakings where success is highly likely.</p>
          <p class="txt">In contrast, those who believe that intelligence can be increased&mdash;who, using Dweck&#39;s terms, have <em>growth mindsets</em>&mdash;are convinced that with dedication and effort, they can develop their skills and abilities and increase their personal competence.</p>
          <p class="txt">Research lends considerable support to Dweck&#39;s belief that these mindsets can determine important outcomes. Growth mindsets, explain Dweck and Yeager (2018), lead students to seek challenges that foster learning: Their ultimate goal is to increase their competence and to master learning objectives. In contrast, goals associated with fixed mindsets typically reflect the confidence individuals have in their abilities. Those who are highly confident and think they have a generous amount of this thing called intelligence are more likely to undertake difficult and challenging tasks than those who don&#39;t believe they possess very much intelligence. In the face of failure, both those who are highly confident and those less confident are likely to feel helpless, not persist when success seems unlikely, and avoid future challenges.</p>
          <p class="txt">Dweck argues that schools and parents need to consider interventions that focus on developing growth mindsets. These, she insists, have tremendous potential for increasing academic performance and for reducing feelings of inadequacy and helplessness that are often associated with fixed mindsets.</p>
          <p class="txt">Unfortunately, many children grow up with the notion that intelligence is fixed and that little can be done to change it. However, considerable research supports the belief that growth mindsets can be fostered in various ways, including workshops, tutoring sessions, online programs, and other interventions that emphasize how brains develop, grow, and change (e.g., Yeager et al., 2016). These interventions typically underline that it is especially important not to repeatedly praise children for being intelligent&mdash;an act that implies that intelligence is fixed. It is even more important not to berate children for apparent shortcomings, which also suggests the unchanging nature of intelligence. Instead, as Haimovitz and Dweck (2017) suggest, the most effective approach is to direct praise at efforts and strategies that are successful. One of the fundamentally important tasks of educators is to provide children with challenging tasks at which, with effort and guidance, they will succeed.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
       <p class="intro">Standardized intelligence tests and tests of specific aptitudes are used mainly for prediction. In a sense, an intelligence or aptitude test score is a prediction that an individual will do well&mdash;or less well&mdash;on tasks that require intelligence or specific aptitudes.</p>

<div class="section-body">
 <h2 class="h2">The Ratio IQ</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Most intelligence tests yield a score traditionally referred to as an <strong>intelligence quotient (IQ)</strong>. The concept of the IQ, as it was originally derived, is quite simple. The reasoning goes like this: A child who can reason and solve problems that, say, other average 4-year-olds can solve is said to have a <strong>mental age</strong> of 4. Now if that child happens to be 4 years old (has a chronological age of 4), we can conclude that this is an average child. The ratio of this child&#39;s mental age (MA) to chronological age (CA) is 4/4&thinsp;, which yields a <strong>quotient</strong> (a ratio) of 1. Multiply that by 100 and, voil&agrave;: an IQ of 100. This approach to calculating the IQ yields what is termed a <strong>ratio&nbsp;IQ</strong>. </p>
          <p class="txt">Not surprisingly, the average IQ on most standardized measures of intelligence is 100. Tests are simply normed so that average intellectual performance yields a converted score of 100 (see Table 10.5).</p>

 			          <li class="li_text">Because conversion tables are based on a normal distribution, this means that about 68% of the population has an average measured IQ between 85 and 115. Only slightly more than 2% score above 130 or below 70.</li>

           <p class="txt">Intelligence tests no longer compute IQ on the basis of the quotient that results when mental age is divided by chronological age&mdash;although we still call the results <em>intelligence quotients</em>. Instead, IQ is arrived at by comparing the test taker&#39;s raw score with the scores of comparable individuals and converting them by using tables provided by the test makers. Most IQ tests are standardized in such a way that the average for any large group is around 100, and about two thirds of all individuals score within 15 points on either side of the average (that is, between 85 and 115). The normal distribution for intelligence is shown in Figure 10.3. This current method of calculating the IQ does not yield a ratio IQ (as did the original mental age to chronological age ratio). Instead, it yields what is termed a <strong>deviation IQ</strong>. </p>

  <div class="section-lead">
       <p class="intro">There are hundreds of different intelligence tests.</p>
   </div>

<div class="section-body"> 	         
    <div class="single-column">        
          <p class="txt">Some are designed to be administered to one person at a time. These individual tests typically require a skilled examiner and may take an hour or more to administer and perhaps as much time again to score, interpret, and summarize. As a result, they are far more expensive to use than are group tests, which are administered to larger groups. </p>
          <p class="txt">Group tests can usually be administered by anyone who can follow the test manufacturer&#39;s instructions, and scoring them requires no special training. However, as Vrana and Vrana (2017) argue, we may be very close to the point that advances in artificial intelligence will make it possible to administer individual intelligence tests such as the Wechsler tests using only a computer, without the need for a trained psychologist.</p>
          <p class="txt">Most individual tests ask for a variety of responses. Test takers might be required to write responses to oral questions, read and write replies to written items, calculate mathematical problems, draw and illustrate answers, and listen and respond verbally to other items. In contrast, most group tests are paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests. Individual intelligence tests are especially useful for diagnosing specific learning problems and for identifying exceptional talents in children.</p>

   <div class="inner-section">
   <h2 class="h2">Individual Intelligence Tests</h2>
     <div class="single-column">        
          <p class="txt">The two most widely known and commonly used individual intelligence tests are the Stanford&ndash;Binet and the Wechsler intelligence tests.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">The Stanford&ndash;Binet</h3>
          <p class="txt">The Stanford&ndash;Binet is an American version of a test developed in France by Binet and Simon, first published in 1905 (Binet, 1905). The American version was released by Lewis Terman of Stanford University in 1916&mdash;hence the new name, the Stanford&ndash;Binet. The test was revised and renormed for the fifth time in 2003. In its current editions, it contains a relatively equal number of verbal and nonverbal items. As a result, it provides both verbal and nonverbal scores that can be converted to a verbal IQ, a performance IQ, and a combined IQ. It is especially useful for clinical assessments as well as for educational placement decisions. A very general indication of the meanings of Stanford&ndash;Binet intelligence test scores is shown in Table 10.6.</p>
          <p class="txt">The Stanford&ndash;Binet consists of a variety of subtests, different combinations of which are sometimes used for diagnostic purposes. For example, certain subtests are sometimes used to identify gifted children (McGowan, Holtzman, Coyne, &amp; Miles, 2016). It is also frequently used with children with autism (Baum, Shear, Howe, &amp; Bishop, 2015). </p>

         <h3 class="h3">The Wechsler Tests</h3>
          <p class="txt">Like the Stanford&ndash;Binet, the Wechsler is an individual intelligence test dating back many years (Wechsler, 1944). It comes in various forms, including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS-IV, a new version of which is scheduled for 2019); a version for children, the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-V, revised in 2014); and a version for preschool children, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI-III, revised in 2012). </p>
          <p class="txt">The children&#39;s version takes 45 to 65 minutes to administer. It yields a composite IQ score as well as scores on five separate indicators of functioning in different cognitive domains: verbal comprehension, visual spatial, fluid reasoning, working memory, and processing speed. Clinical use of the WISC-V for diagnostic purposes with gifted children and with those who have learning difficulties often involves analyzing patterns of functioning in each of these domains, Different strengths and weakness that sometimes become apparent can suggest appropriate treatments and interventions.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test</h3>
          <p class="txt">The Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, Fourth Edition (PPVT-4) is among the most easily administered and scored of individual intelligence tests. The test is untimed, does not usually take more than 10 to 15 minutes per subject, and can be administered to individuals from age 2 years, 6 months all the way up to age 90. All the participant needs to do is point to the one out of four pictures presented that corresponds to a word the examiner reads. The test measures mainly verbal intelligence&mdash;specifically related to receptive language skills.</p>
          <p class="txt">Because of its very simple format, the Peabody can sometimes be used with those who have severe communication problems or motor dysfunctions. It is also widely used with children who are experiencing developmental delays such as reading problems, or with children with autism spectrum disorder (Krasileva, Sanders, &amp; Bal, 2017). The test can also be employed to assess school readiness in young preschoolers.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Raven&#39;s Progressive Matrices</h3>
          <p class="txt">A widely used, largely nonverbal intelligence test is the <strong>Raven&#39;s Progressive Matrices (RPM)</strong>, developed by John Raven in 1936 (Raven, 1936). It consists of only 60 items and is available in booklet form or online. Items are patterns with missing elements, which the test taker is asked to find. Patterns are usually presented in the form of a 4-, 9-, or 16-cell matrix.</p>
          <p class="txt">The original RPM was designed primarily for research into the inheritance of intelligence, but it is now widely used in school settings as a measure of general intelligence. Because of its low reliance on verbal skills, it has proved especially useful for testing children with <strong>autism spectrum disorder</strong> and <strong>Asperger&#39;s syndrome</strong>&mdash;both of which are often marked by communication and other social interaction problems&mdash;as well as for children with other special needs.</p>

  <h2 class="h2">Group Intelligence Tests</h2>
    <div class="single-column">    
          <p class="txt">Unlike the Stanford&ndash;Binet and the Wechsler tests, group tests of intelligence do not generally require a skilled and trained examiner. They are usually paper-and-pencil or computer-administered tests that can be given by anyone to a large group of candidates at one time. </p>
          <p class="txt">Some group intelligence tests are computer-adaptive tests. That is, they are presented by computers programmed to estimate the examinee&#39;s proficiency and present items selected accordingly. Computer-adaptive tests vary for each individual. Ideally, they eliminate the need for the more proficient candidates to respond to a range of overly simple items that provide examiners with little information. By the same token, less proficient examinees are not exposed to items that are impossibly difficult for them. Accordingly, an advantage of computer-adaptive testing is that it provides reliable information with far fewer items and in a much shorter period of time.</p>
          <p class="txt">As we saw in Chapter 3, the SmarterBalanced Assessment Consortium (2018) has developed a computer-adaptive library of assessments and other educational material, some of which are used by a large number of states, including California, as college admission exams. Similarly, the widely used Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) is administered mainly as a computer-adaptive test. Although neither of these assessments yields an IQ score, their results are considered to reflect general ability as well as achievement.</p>
          <p class="txt">Interestingly, the original Binet IQ test and subsequent revisions select the sequence of questions and tasks based on the test taker&#39;s responses. Hence, as early as 1905, Binet had developed an adaptive test&mdash;adaptive, but not exactly computer adaptive.</p>
          <p class="txt">There are literally hundreds of group tests of intelligence, three of which are discussed briefly&nbsp;here.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">The Draw-a-Person Test</h3>
          <p class="txt">A very simple and intriguing test is the Draw-a-Person (DAP) test, first developed by Goodenough (1926). It was originally called the <em>draw-a-man test</em> but was later revised by Harris (1963) and Naglieri (1988), becoming the Draw-a-Person test (or the Goodenough&ndash;Harris Drawing Test) to remove the sexist bias and to permit the drawing of female forms. </p>
  <a id="p411"></a>
		  <p class="txt">The DAP test is based on the assumption that the level of children&#39;s mental development is reflected in their drawings. Accordingly, the test simply asks that the child draw the very best person possible, with no time limit for doing so. Drawings are scored mainly on the basis of detail and accuracy, following a well-defined set of criteria (see Figure 10.4). Tables for converting raw scores to IQ scores are provided.</p>

    <div class="single-column">   
	          <p class="txt">The DAP test provides a fast and easy method of obtaining a general indication of cognitive development. It is also sometimes used clinically to assess stress and emotional difficulties (Dyer, 2018). In fact, it is one of the most frequently used measures of mental functioning among psychological practitioners. As Rehrig and Stromswold (2018) report following their investigation of the relationship between DAP scores and other measures of intelligence, in addition to measuring intelligence, the DAP can provide useful information about motor skill development and disturbances in at-risk children. It is also useful for understanding children&#39;s gender identity and gender expression issues (McLaughlin &amp; Sharp, 2018). However, judgments of social and intellectual development based on the DAP are not always very reliable or valid (Miles, Fulbrook, &amp; Mainwaring-Magi, 2018). </p>

        <h3 class="h3">The Cognitive Abilities Test</h3>
          <p class="txt">The Cognitive Abilities Test (CogAT) is a paper-and-pencil test suitable for kindergarten through 12th grade (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2018). It is a widely used test designed to measure general reasoning (cognitive) abilities in the three areas that are most closely related to academic success: verbal, nonverbal, and quantitative. It yields separate scores in each of these areas&mdash;but these, the publishers caution, are not IQ scores. Rather, they are measures of aptitude in these three areas. Tables are provided for converting raw test scores to percentile scores to indicate performance relative to other children at the same grade level. Not surprisingly, the national average on this test is the 50th percentile. This test is widely used for general assessment of students. It is also used extensively to identify gifted and talented children (Carman, Walther, &amp; Bartsch, 2018). </p>
  <a id="p412"></a>
        <h3 class="h3">Otis&ndash;Lennon School Ability Test </h3>
          <p class="txt">The Otis&ndash;Lennon School Ability Test is another test designed to assess school-related ability. It consists of seven different levels of items suitable for prekindergarten through age 18. Items are multiple-choice and are intermingled (e.g., vocabulary, reasoning, numerical, and other items are in mixed order) and are presented in order of increasing difficulty. The test is designed to assess thinking skills and to detect strengths and weaknesses in reasoning tasks. It yields a single standardized score labeled a <em>school ability index</em> (SAI). Much like the Stanford&ndash;Binet and the Wechsler tests, the SAI is normed to have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 16.</p>
          <p class="txt">The Otis&ndash;Lennon is a widely used test that has been shown to be useful, even with very young children, as an indicator of abilities related to performance in school. Some school jurisdictions use it to identify gifted children. However, as Reed (2007) argues, because of its heavy reliance on verbal skills, extensive use of this test to identify gifted learners tends to overlook nonnative English speakers. In addition, test-preparation guides and materials are easily available, a fact that tends to favor children whose parents provide them with appropriate pretest experiences.</p>

          <h2 class="h2">Testing and Accommodations for Children With Special Needs</h2>
          <div class="single-column"> 
          <p class="txt">Many dozens of different types of standardized tests are used with <strong>special needs students</strong>&mdash;students who require special instruction, equipment, or services to develop to their full potential. Among them are individual intelligence tests like the RPM or the Stanford&ndash;Binet and the Wechsler scales. These provide a general measure of intellectual ability. Tests that are not highly verbal (like the RPM) and the DAP test may provide a more accurate assessment for certain children, such as those with autism spectrum disorder (Tantam, 2012).</p>
          <p class="txt">In addition to these individual tests, most of which are expensive and time consuming, a large number of group tests of intelligence (ability) are widely used to identify the gifted and talented, including both the Otis&ndash;Lennon and the CogAT. The National Association for Gifted Children (2018) is a valuable source for information about how to access gifted education in your state. It also provides detailed listings of resources, including publications, assessments, and professional development information for educators and parents.</p>
          <p class="txt">Also available are many standardized tests designed to look at specific learning disabilities. These disabilities are marked by a significant lack of progress in an area (most often related to either language or arithmetic) in the absence of a general depression in intellectual ability or emotional disorder. However, diagnoses of learning disabilities are not based on the results of a single test. In addition to considering general measures of intelligence and achievement, depending on the child&#39;s learning challenges, language testing, motor skills testing, sensory evaluations, and other assessments may be required. </p>
   <a id="p413"></a>
		  <p class="txt">Often, too, accommodations need to be made for physical or language issues. For example, highly verbal tests such as the Otis&ndash;Lennon may be unfair for ELL students; measures such as the DAP, which requires the ability to draw, might not be appropriate for children with cerebral palsy or other physical challenges; and most computer-administered tests would be ill advised for children with visual, auditory, or motor-coordination problems. In each of these cases, different assessments need to be used or other accommodations made. For some of these children, tests of <em>visual motor integration</em>, such as the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt, might be advised. These tests help determine whether the child is having problems coordinating visual cues, motor acts, and intentions&mdash;an issue that might make it difficult to learn to draw or write. Similarly, for children who have language issues, including ELL students, diagnoses of learning disabilities might require the use of a test such as the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals. Although these various tests may be essential for detecting and assessing special needs and for determining the best interventions, some important cautions and guidelines should be kept in mind.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are some myths surrounding IQ?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
       <p class="intro">Intelligence tests are among the best tools we have for predicting academic success (Giofre, Borella, &amp; Mammarella, 2017). Unfortunately, they are less than perfectly valid or reliable, and their use is sometimes highly controversial. </p>
   </div>


<div class="section-body">

        <div class="single-column">
            <p class="txt">The controversy is apparent in reactions to books such as <em>The Bell Curve</em> (Herrnstein &amp; Murray, 1994) and <em>The Global Bell Curve</em> (Lynn, 2008). What these books say, essentially, is that measured IQ is a clear and important predictor of success in school as well as in a wide variety of endeavors such as parenting and business. They cite evidence, as well, that low IQ is correlated with poverty and low socioeconomic status, that it predicts outcomes like being on welfare or having unwanted children, and that it is inherited and reflects important racial differences in intelligence.</p>
   <a id="p414"></a>
			<p class="txt">On the whole, these are inflammatory notions. Critics have been quick to reject the views that IQ tests identify those of us who will fail and that the tests separate us on the basis of race (e.g., Gould, 1996). Flynn (2017) suggests that one of the reactions to this controversy has been an apparent reluctance to undertake new research that might shed light on the issue.</p>
            <p class="txt">The controversy over large-scale IQ testing, and over the widespread use of these tests for important educational decisions, also has to do with a number of myths and misunderstandings surrounding the meaning and usefulness of the IQ. Among these myths are the all-too-frequent assumptions that IQ is synonymous with intelligence, that IQ tests are fair and impartial, that IQ tests measure all the important things, and that IQ is fixed and unchanging. Some of these myths are summarized in Table 10.7.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Flynn Effect</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
           <p class="txt">In connection with the myth that IQ is fixed and unchanging, some data suggest that Americans have gained around 22 IQ points in the past 70 years (Flynn &amp; Weiss, 2007). This phenomenon, labeled the <strong>Flynn effect</strong>, is one of the reasons that intelligence tests have to be renormed frequently. In effect, they have to be made harder or their scaled scores have to be readjusted; otherwise, our average measured IQ would be as shown in Figure 10.5. </p>
          <p class="txt">The Flynn effect has been attributed to better nutrition, increased literacy resulting from more educational opportunities, and increased ability to solve abstract problems, perhaps due to the widespread availability of technology. Others have suggested that an increase in the use of culture-fair tests may be linked to an overall increase in measured IQ.</p>
   <a id="p415"></a>
		  <p class="txt">Interestingly, there is even evidence of the Flynn effect in the sorts of children&#39;s drawing that the DAP test uses to measure general intelligence. Genovese (2018) found significant changes in children&#39;s drawings of human figures when he compared drawings published in 1902 with others from 1926, 1963, and 1968. It seems that children&#39;s drawings of the human figure have become progressively more detailed and more complete over the decades. </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Are IQ Tests Useful?</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Still, researchers agree that many of the less controversial conclusions regarding measured IQ are accurate and useful. Measured IQ does predict success, both in life and in school (Boccio &amp; Beaver, 2015); in a number of studies, lower intelligence has been associated with a higher probability of criminal behavior (Freeman, 2012); and lower measured IQ appears to be related to a higher probability of alcohol use disorders (Kendler, Ohlsson, Sundquist, &amp; Sundquist, 2017). </p>
          <p class="txt">As a result, measured IQ is very useful for important decisions involving things such as school placement, college admission, job placement, and scholastic awards. And when IQ tests are properly developed, used, and interpreted, they should not be biased against any group. IQ tests are impeccably objective and impartial. The test does not know whether the test taker is rich or poor, Black or White, male or female. And it really doesn&#39;t give a hoot. </p>

          <p class="txt">Literally thousands of standardized tests are used in education as well as in psychology, business, government, and elsewhere. School achievement tests alone are almost too numerous to count. So how is the teacher to select from this vast array?</p>
          <p class="txt">In many cases the classroom teacher is not asked to make a choice: Selections are made, and sometimes mandated, at higher levels. Even if that is the case, how will those at higher levels make their selections? What steps can they, or the classroom teacher, take to ensure that they make the best of all possible choices?</p>
          <p class="txt">The simple answer is to consult the <strong><em>Mental Measurements Yearbook</em></strong>. The first edition of this yearbook was produced by Oscar K. Buros in 1938 (it was then known as the <em>Buros Mental Measurements Yearbook</em>). It is still produced annually by the Buros Center for Testing at the University of Nebraska but now takes the form of an online database. The database includes archived copies of all editions of the yearbook, dating back to 1938. In total, this archive contains detailed, consumer-oriented, expert reviews of more than 10,000 standardized tests.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
             <p class="txt">In addition to single-subject tests, there are <strong>standardized achievement test batteries</strong>. By definition, test batteries are made up of different subtests. Accordingly, standardized achievement test batteries consist of different subtests that survey student achievement in a variety of subject areas. Together, these tests make up a single standardized assessment. Most of the widely used achievement test batteries are multilevel&mdash;meaning they are designed for use at various grade levels.</p>
          <p class="txt">Among the different areas assessed by most achievement test batteries are reading skills, language knowledge (vocabulary, grammar, and spelling); mathematics (computation, problem solving, and mathematical concepts); study skills (reading maps, graphs, tables; using reference sources); science; and social studies. </p>
          <p class="txt">One advantage of using test batteries rather than many different single-subject tests is that the tests included in a battery are usually all normed on the same sample and at the same time. Single-subject tests, on the other hand, may be normed on very different samples and may provide different types of scoring information. As a result, test batteries are usually characterized by more consistency in test construction and administration, and comparisons among subject areas are more valid. </p>
          <p class="txt">Another advantage of using a test battery is that it generally costs less, and often takes less time, than administering several different single-subject tests. Sometimes, however, single-subject tests provide broader and deeper coverage of the subject than might the corresponding subtest in a battery. </p>
          <p class="txt">Standardized achievement test batteries intended for national use are typically designed to cover the most common instructional objectives. The items selected for these tests are chosen to reflect common content and standards as well as to differentiate among respondents. Items that do not discriminate well tend to be eliminated, even if they are closely aligned with content.</p>
          <p class="txt">Because test makers tend to reject items that do not discriminate, and because standardized tests are based on the content that is common to the largest number of schools, some achievement tests may fail to assess content and skill areas that are specific to local curricula. Partly for this reason, and partly to meet legislative requirements, many states have hired professional test developers and test publishing companies to develop state-specific, locally normed tests. These are especially useful in demonstrating school progress. </p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the benefits and challenges with computer-adaptive standardized achievement tests? How do they differ from traditional tests?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">     
	   <p class="intro">There are a large number of commercially available standardized achievement tests. Some are traditional paper-and-pencil tests or computer-based tests; others are computer-adaptive tests.</p>
  </div>

<div class="section-body">
<h2 class="h2">Computer-Adaptive Standardized Achievement Tests</h2>

		  <figure class="photo-right"><img src="Images/10.3.jpg" alt="Middle school students sit at computers taking tests." title="Middle school students sit at computers taking tests." id="img10.3"/>
           <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">FatCamera/E+/Getty Images Plus</p>
          <p class="caption">Standardized achievement tests are increasingly available online. This simplifies scoring and record keeping considerably. But, as this examinee has discovered, it doesn&#39;t make the tests any easier.</p>
           </figcaption>
          </figure>
		
    <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Computer-adaptive testing refers to computer-delivered tests that adjust the difficulty of items based on the computer&#39;s estimates of the examinee&#39;s ability. As we saw, the SmarterBalanced Assessment Consortium (2018) provides an extensive library of online, computer-administered achievement tests, some of which are computer adaptive. Also, the DIBELS offers different forms of a computer-adaptive test designed to measure early language literacy, mainly for ELL students.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Advantages</h3>
          <p class="txt">In computer-adaptive testing, the computer is programmed to present only those items that are expected to yield the most accurate and most useful information. In effect, it adapts its questions to the examinee&#39;s responses.</p>
          <p class="txt">Good computer-adaptive tests typically are shorter than more conventional paper-and-pencil tests, and they often provide more detailed information about patterns of learner strengths and weaknesses. In addition, results are usually available in a short time. And, claims Gibbons (2017), the evidence suggests that computer-adaptive tests can be precise and efficient, as well as brief. For example, based on an investigation involving a sample of 12,736 students, Martin and Lazendic (2018) report that, when compared with fixed-order computer tests, adaptive-computer tests yielded more precise measurement and resulted in higher student motivation and engagement.</p>
          <p class="txt">In effect, computer-adaptive testing uses computer technology and measurement theory to develop test items and appropriate software. Item selection often involves complex mathematical procedures (e.g., Huebner, Wang, Quinlan, &amp; Seubert, 2016). These procedures are designed to maximize test efficiency and precision.</p>
   <a id="p419"></a>
		  <p class="txt">Because developing computer-adaptive tests requires generating and testing a large pool of test items, the process is costly and time consuming. As a result, developing these tests is seldom economical except when intended for use with large groups. Once developed, however, the tests can also be administered to small groups. </p>
          <p class="txt">Kantrowitz, Dawson, and Fetzer (2011) suggest that another advantage of computer-adaptive testing is that it reduces some of the limitations of <strong>unproctored Internet testing</strong>&mdash;a phenomenon that has grown increasingly common with the proliferation of distance learning. Because a computer-adaptive test essentially presents a different test to each examinee, and because it is usually programmed to evaluate responses immediately, it is less likely to be affected by the possibility that test takers will discuss items and learn from each other. Nor are test takers likely to have time to computer search suitable responses. Furthermore, no single candidate is able to obtain a copy of all test items following a single sitting. This is not the case for tests in which the same items are presented to all candidates in the same order.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Challenges</h3>
          <p class="txt">Moving from traditional to computer-adaptive tests presents at least three important challenges.</p>

          	<ol class="nl">
          		<li class="li_text">In Reckase&#39;s (2010) estimate, a good computer-adaptive achievement test may require the development of as many as 1,600 or more items&mdash;compared with perhaps 200 for a more traditional test. </li>
          		<li class="li_text">These 1,600 items need to be administered to large pools of learners, analyzed, sorted, and embedded in software purposely designed to permit the adaptive selection of items depending on learner responses. Developing the items and the related software poses difficult and expensive challenges.</li>
          		<li class="li_text">Perhaps the greatest challenge is that most school systems will experience significant hardware shortcomings in trying to administer computer-based tests on a large-scale basis. For example, a 3-hour test administered to 200,000 learners will require more than 600,000 hours of computer time. In most cases it is inadvisable to allow students to use their own computers; doing so can jeopardize the security of the items. Yet school jurisdictions do not have an unlimited supply of computers, and they can administer the test to only a few students in a single day.</li>
          		<li class="li_text">There is evidence that computer-adaptive testing may underestimate the performance of students with test anxiety, resulting in measures that may be not only unfair but also significantly less valid (Colwell, 2013).</li>
          	</ol>

		  <p class="txt">Despite the challenges and costs associated with developing computer-adaptive tests, a number of standardized achievement tests are adaptive. For example, the Graduate Record Examination is the most widely used test for admission to graduate schools. It is an adaptive test, not on an item-to-item but on a subtest-to-subtest basis. Put another way, it does not choose each item following an estimate of the candidate&#39;s ability based on responses to previous items, but rather chooses the next section of each subtest based on performance on the previous section (see Educational Testing Service, 2018).</p>
          <p class="txt">The aReading and aMath are other examples of computer-adaptive achievement tests (FastBridge Learning, 2018). These tests are closely aligned to the <em>common core standards</em> and are available for students from kindergarten to grade 12. They can be administered to each student individually or in a group setting and can be completed in about 15 to 30 minutes. They can be used for formative assessment, wherein computer-adaptive testing might occur as often as 5 times a year. These ongoing tests sessions are used to identify deficits and point toward interventions. In addition, the tests are designed for summative assessment. </p>

    <div class="inner-section">
      <h2 class="h2">Traditional Standardized Achievement Tests</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">In light of the challenges of computer-adaptive testing, and in spite of its promise, paper-and-pencil and traditional computer-based tests continue to be widely used. </p>

        <h3 class="h3">Examples</h3>
          <p class="txt">Among the better known and more widely used standardized achievement tests are the following. </p>
    	   <ul class="bl">
               <li class="li_text">The Iowa Assessments and the Iowa Tests of Educational Development (ITED). Both of these tests are provided by the College of Education of the University of Iowa. The Iowa assessments are intended for K&ndash;8 students; the ITED covers grades 9 to 12. Their main goal is to serve a formative function in helping teachers improve teaching. Rather than concentrating on subject matter content, these widely used assessments look more at students&#39; cognitive and problem-solving skills (University of Iowa College of Education, 2018).</li>
               <li class="li_text">TerraNova CAT 6 (2nd Edition&reg;). The most recent form of the California Achievement Test comes in various forms standardized for K&ndash;12 students. It provides an assessment of student achievement that is both easy to take and to administer (Seton Testing Services, 2018).</li>
               <li class="li_text">The Stanford Achievement Test Series. A standardized achievement test geared toward improving teaching and learning. Also provides a measure highly comparable to measures of ability, such as that provided by the Otis&ndash;Lennon (Pearson Assessment, 2018).</li>
               <li class="li_text">The Metropolitan Achievement Test. A paper-and-pencil achievement battery for K&ndash;12 students. Designed to evaluate student ability and predict future success (Tests.com, 2017).</li>
               <li class="li_text">The PARCC. The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Carreers (or PARCC) is a standardized college entrance assessment. It was developed by a consortium of states, contains innovative test questions, and is designed to assess student&#39;s college readiness (Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, 2018).</li>
		       <li class="li_text">The SmarterBalanced Assortment Consortium. Makes available a collection of standardized achievement assessments for kindergarten to grade 12, along with a digital library of resources for teachers. Provides tests for interim assessments that can be used for formative purposes. Also provides for computer-adaptive assessments, selecting items on the basis of student responses. (SmarterBalanced Assessment Consortium, 2018).</li>
           </ul>

          <p class="txt">Some of these standardized achievement tests&mdash;the TerraNova CAT 6, for example&mdash;include constructed-response and performance tasks as well as a range of multiple-choice items. Most typically provide indications of growth as well as measures of higher level thinking skills. Many of them are designed to tap objectives that make up common core standards. Recall that these are statements of the basic goals and instructional objectives that states are encouraged to adopt and use to determine curricula in each core subject. They are also meant to serve as a basis for statewide standardized testing.</p>
     <a id="p421"></a>
		  <p class="txt">In addition to these test batteries are a number of single-subject achievement tests. Some are intended mainly for diagnostic purposes. For example, in addition to the Stanford battery of achievement tests, there is also the Stanford Diagnostic Mathematics Test and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Test.</p>
          <p class="txt">Unlike achievement test batteries that are typically given to all students in a class, grade, or school, diagnostic achievement tests are usually given only to students who are having learning difficulties. Such tests can be useful for diagnosing specific learning disabilities.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Scoring and Interpreting Standardized Achievement Tests</h3>
          <p class="txt">Some standardized achievement tests are scored by teachers; others, by the test publisher. Scoring, like test administration, is done according to specific guidelines provided by the test publisher. Raw scores are then usually converted into one or more standard scores. As we saw, a standard score can take one of several forms based on the normal curve and having a predetermined mean and standard deviation (e.g., Z-scores, T-scores, or stanines; see Figure 10.1.) Often, too, achievement test raw scores can be converted to percentile ranks. Converting the score is as simple as knowing the child&#39;s age and grade and then reading the corresponding score from a table.</p>
          <p class="txt">Percentile rank conversions are somewhat simpler for both parents and teachers to understand. Knowing that a child&#39;s achievement test results place her at the 84th percentile says, immediately, that 84% of the norming sample at her age and grade level obtained a lower score. But knowing that she scored 1 standard deviation above the mean is not nearly as informative for many people&mdash;although that, too, is roughly the 84th percentile.</p>
          <p class="txt">Many of the most widely used standardized achievement tests provide computer-prepared reports that include detailed information about performance on each subtest, often with visual comparisons among them in the form of graphs and charts. Information might be provided for each student. In addition, summary information for entire classes or even schools is often included, along with comparisons with state and national standards. For example, the TerraNova CAT 6 provides both paper and online reports that show student performance relative to common core&ndash;based learning objectives. </p>
          <p class="txt">Not all standardized tests are created equal. Some are more valid than others; some, more reliable. And of course, their validity and reliability are specific to the groups and purposes for which they are used. As noted earlier, current editions of the <em>Mental Measurements Yearbook</em> (2018) provide excellent and detailed reviews of all the major standardized tests. Possible limitations of some&mdash;though clearly not all&mdash; standardized tests are summarized here.</p>

		  	<ul class="bl">
               <li class="li_text">Because most tests are multiple-choice format, there is a possibility that clever&mdash;or less clever&mdash;guesses might affect the outcome.</li>
               <li class="li_text">A multiple-choice format puts undue emphasis on language skills and may inadvertently penalize certain individuals and groups.</li>
               <li class="li_text">Although scores are less reliable at lower ages, they are often treated with as much confidence as those for older students.</li>
               <li class="li_text">Measurement errors&mdash;sometimes inherent in the test, sometimes resulting from factors within the student (fatigue, emotional problems, family problems)&mdash;can dramatically affect test results.</li>
               <li class="li_text">Time constraints systematically penalize students who require more time.</li>
		       <li class="li_text">The sample of questions included in any one battery of tests or in any subtest might be inappropriate for some classes, depending on local curricula.</li>
           </ul>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What is the role of high-stakes tests in today&#39;s schools? What are some of the consequences of high-stakes testing?</span></h2>
  </div>

  <div class="section-lead">     
	   <p class="intro">Many criticisms of standardized testing have to do with their misinterpretation and misuse. Given the limitations and criticisms listed in the previous section, it is clear that no important education decisions (such as placement decisions) should be based on a single standardized assessment. Nor should a school&#39;s program be judged solely on the basis of such a test.</p>
      </div>


<div class="section-body">
    <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">A goal of standardized achievement testing is clearly to improve the quality of the American educational experience. ESSA, the act that regulates K&ndash;12 education in the United States, requires that all states set up educational standards and hold schools accountable for student performance Few will argue that these intentions and requirements violate our sense of what is right, or that wanting all students to graduate from high school and be prepared for college or a career is wrong.</p>
          <p class="txt">However, these goals may not always be realistic, and trying to implement them has its costs. Yet, ESSA and the IDEA make schools and teachers accountable for providing all learners with fair and optimal opportunity to reach the goals. Because of this mandated accountability, a new era has been ushered in&mdash;the era of high-stakes testing. </p>
          <p class="key-point">How do you make schools and teachers accountable for these goals? The simple answer is, by using tests. </p>
          <p class="txt">The NCLB, which preceded ESSA, mandated the use of tests to determine whether students had reached the levels of proficiency required by law; it also required that the quality of teachers be assessed. Furthermore, it imposed severe sanctions against schools and school systems that did not make sufficient progress toward federally mandated standards. As a result, some of these assessments had extraordinarily high stakes. </p>

       <div id="ecbox10-3">
		 <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">ESSA has resulted in a significant reduction in the magnitude of the stakes involved in current standardized educational assessment. States can now design their own standards. And although many of these are based on <em>Common Core State Standards</em> and still reflect the lofty ideals that characterized the NCLB, they are no longer assessed by means of mandatory, nationwide testing programs. Not only are states free to select or develop their own testing materials, they are also permitted to use a wider range of measures of student performance. However, for high schools, states are required to base their assessments on the results of state standardized tests in reading, science and math, ELL student proficiency, and 12th-grade graduation rates, as well as one nonacademic measure. These nonacademic measures, which must be the same throughout the state, might include things such as indicators of school climate and safety, access to advanced course work, or evidence of student engagement (Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development, 2018).</p>

        </figcaption>
         </figure>

          <div class="single-column">
         <p class="txt">Although requirements to meet certain standards of accountability have been relaxed with the passage of ESSA, they have not been entirely removed. For example, states are required to use their assessment data to identify schools that are in need of improvement. These schools are defined as the lowest performing 5% of the state&#39;s schools. States are also required to identify all schools where one or more subgroups are underperforming, as well as high schools where fewer than two thirds of all students graduate. Districts in which schools have been identified as needing improvement must then look at allocating funding for and implementing interventions. For these schools, districts, and teachers, statewide assessments continue to have what are potentially very high stakes.</p>
          <p class="txt">Tests used to assess the qualifications of teachers&mdash;often one or more of the Praxis&trade; tests&mdash;can also be extremely high stake for teachers and for those who want to be teachers. One form of the Praxis&trade; tests is often used to make decisions about who should be admitted to teacher-training facilities; another may be used for teacher certification; and a third looks at how well a practicing teacher is performing and tries to identify areas that might require improvement. The results of these tests can change an individual&#39;s&nbsp;life.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">The Controversy: Cons</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Many educators and parents think that today&#39;s students are overtested. It is perhaps telling that more than 1,000 U.S. colleges no longer require standardized admissions tests (Soares, &nbsp;2018). </p>
          <p class="txt">Certainly, students are tested far more often today than they were in the days of our grandparents. And the testing is of a different nature; it isn&#39;t designed simply to determine who will pass and who will fail. Some of it&mdash;probably far too little&mdash;is meant to foster good teaching and effective learning (formative assessment); some describes how learners have done in a unit of study (summative assessment); but much of it is high-stakes testing mandated by legislation such as ESSA and the IDEA. </p>
   <a id="p424"></a>
		  <p class="txt">High-stakes testing continues to be highly controversial, and the bulk of the research and opinion in this area is negative. There is so much pressure put on children, and on their parents, that many will go to extraordinary lengths to make sure that their children do well on standardized assessments. In her examination of test- and school-related behaviors and beliefs of 52 New York City parents, Roda (2017) found that White parents believed that being a good parent meant paying for test preparation whenever possible and trying to make sure that their children were selected for gifted and talented programs. Parents of color, on the other hand, felt little pressure to have their children do well enough to be placed in classes for the gifted, where they would be in the minority. </p>
          <p class="txt">As Jolly (2015) points out, the importance to states and to school districts of test results has led some schools to shift funds away from gifted programs to other programs in an effort to boost school performance.</p>
          <p class="txt">Guisbond (2012) puts it bluntly: &quot;[High-stakes testing] has severely damaged educational quality and equity, with its narrowing and limiting effects falling most severely on the poor&quot; (p. 3). She goes on to explain that labeling schools as being in need of improvement has undermined educational reform and that many schools have become test-preparation programs and little else.</p>
          <p class="txt">Among the negatives associated with high-stakes tests are the following.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">1. Narrowing of Assessments</h3>
          <p class="txt">There is evidence that testing limits teachers in their attempts to provide students with rich learning experiences. Increased emphasis on high-stakes testing has caused many educators to focus on state-sanctioned standardized tests and to abandon efforts to integrate assessment into day-to-day instruction with a view to improving teaching and learning </p>

        <h3 class="h3">2. Narrowing of Approaches to Instruction</h3>
          <p class="txt">High-stakes testing has discouraged teachers from experimenting with new pedagogies such as cooperative learning for fear that introducing new approaches might result in a lowering of test scores (Ferguson-Patrick, 2018). Many spend much of their time drilling students on basic, test-related materials and having them do practice tests that parallel the high-stakes tests on which the school&#39;s success rests. Instead of preparing and delivering content lessons, they direct their instruction to the test itself&mdash;which, if successful intelligence implies adaptation, is not an entirely stupid thing to do. After all, some research indicates that by carefully preparing test takers beforehand, you can increase scores even on intelligence tests by an average of 7 to 15 points (Bloemers, 2007).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">3. Stifling of Creativity</h3>
          <p class="txt">High-stakes testing, argues Robelen (2012), is not very compatible with the need to nurture creativity and promote innovative thinking among learners. Burton and Frazier (2012) agree. High-stakes testing, they claim, is one of the biggest barriers to inquiry (discovery) teaching in science. Test-based instructional methods often dominate in schools, leaving little room for other approaches. If educational systems define proficiency solely in terms of how well the student does on a high-stakes, statewide, multiple-choice test, it becomes increasingly unlikely that great scientists, writers, thinkers, or statesmen will emerge from these schools. </p>
   <a id="p425"></a>
        <h3 class="h3">4. Narrowing of the Curriculum</h3>
          <p class="txt">The need to do well on high-stakes tests, some claim, has a &quot;narrowing&quot; effect on the curriculum. Not only have subjects like visual arts and music been pushed aside but so has physical education, note Seymour and Garrison (2015). High-stakes test preparation has become the main focus of some schools, a fact that contributes to an increasing emphasis on cognitive rather than physical, social, or artistic concerns. As Walker (2014) puts it:</p>
          <p class="ext">Our schools, once vigorous and dynamic centers for learning, have been reduced to mere test prep factories where teachers and students act out a script written by someone who has never visited their classroom and where &quot;achievement&quot; means nothing more than scoring well on a bubble test. (para.&nbsp;7)</p>

        <h3 class="h3">5. Teacher Stress and Attrition</h3>
          <p class="txt">Another possible negative effect of high-stakes testing has to do with teacher attrition. High-stakes testing, suggest Gonzalez, Peters, Orange, and Grigsby (2017), has a profound influence on teachers&#39; job-related stress. In their study, teachers reported that lack of time to prepare, changes in the curriculum, and the need to administer a variety of tests all contributed to increased stress. Sass, Flores, Claeys, and P&eacute;rez (2012) looked at the relationship between school district ratings on state-mandated standardized achievement tests and teacher turnover. The study revealed two important findings: Teachers were significantly more likely to abandon the profession now, in the &quot;high-stakes era,&quot; than had previously been the case; and teacher attrition was higher in the low-performing schools as well as in charter schools, where pressure to do well on state-mandated tests would presumably be very high.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">6. Unfairness of High-Stakes Tests</h3>
          <p class="txt">There is evidence, too, that high-stakes testing may be unfair for certain children such as second-language learners, the poor, lower achievers, and others who experience various disadvantages. For one thing, emphasis on these tests draws the teacher&#39;s attention away from the tasks of preparing alternative assessments for children with special needs and devoting time and effort to differentiating instruction and carrying out interventions for them. For another, research suggests that lower achieving students report significantly higher levels of test anxiety than higher achieving students (e.g., Stenlund, Eklof, &amp; Lyr&eacute;n, 2017). It also suggests that the need to do well on standardized college entrance examinations may have a detrimental effect on the college aspirations of minority language students. </p>
          <p class="txt">As Rodriguez and Arellano (2016) point out, despite more than 15 years of educational reform premised on the notion that high-stakes test would make educators more accountable for their offerings and lead to measurable improvements, there has been little improvement, an observation with which Dianis, Jackson, and Noguera (2015) agree. This is an example of <em>Campbell&#39;s law</em>, which&mdash;as we saw in Chapter 2&mdash;summarizes the observation that as a social indicator becomes increasingly important, it loses its meaning and its value. Thus, the intended value of standardized testing had to do with the hope and expectation that it would increase educational standards and achievement and improve instructional approaches. But, argue the critics, test results quickly became so important that efforts to improve instruction and achievement were often replaced by an overriding concern with improving test scores at all costs. And perhaps, in the end, high scores on standardized achievement tests no longer have the meaning or the value first envisioned for them.</p>

		  <p class="txt">One of the results of the many negatives associated with high-stakes testing is the apparently growing popularity of what is called the <em>opt-out</em> movement&mdash;parents&#39; decision to refuse to participate in mandated standardized testing. However, although parents have the legal right to decide that their children will opt out of standardized testing for various reasons, school jurisdictions often urge them to reconsider (see, for example, Kirylo, 2018; Fuglei, 2017). Among these reasons are the many arguments on the <em>pro</em> side of the issue.</p>

   <h2 class="h2">The Controversy: Pros</h2>
   <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Standardized testing is not all negative: There are pros as well as cons. Few question the main goals of statewide and national assessment programs: to ensure that the highest possible quality of education be provided for all learners, regardless of their abilities and backgrounds, and to hold teachers and administrators accountable for what happens in their schools. </p>
          <p class="txt">Among the potential strengths and benefits of high-stakes testing are the following.</p>

		  	<ol class="nl">
		  		<li class="li_text">Wallinga (2018) suggests that high-stakes testing can serve to motivate students and teachers and make them work harder. Among other things, assessment provides teachers with access to important information about student learning, which might serve to improve teaching.</li>
		  		<li class="li_text">Having to meet clearly defined proficiency targets can play an important role in ensuring that academic standards are reached. It can lead to an increase in time spent on teaching and learning, to better instructional procedures, and to more effective learning. In the end the educated population may be more competitive in a global environment.</li>
		  		<li class="li_text">Because the results of high-stakes tests are typically communicated to parents, many will become more involved in the education of their children. Hamil (2016) points out that parental involvement and collaboration with the school has traditionally been associated with positive results.</li>
		  		<li class="li_text">Standardized tests are more likely to be valid, reliable, objective, and fair than other forms of evidence on which teachers and educators base their judgments.</li>

      <h3 class="h3">Standardized Tests</h3>
          <p class="txt">A standardized test is a test that is administered and scored under uniform conditions and that provides norms that can be used for interpreting and comparing performance. Standardized tests tend to have high reliability and validity and are a low-cost way of assessing large groups. The two main kinds of standardized tests of interest in educational assessment are achievement and aptitude tests (which include IQ tests). </p>

      <h3 class="h3">Using and Interpreting Standardized Tests</h3>
          <p class="txt">The main purpose of standardized tests is to compare individual or group performance to expected or desired performance (based on the performance of the norming group that represents the population). Raw scores are usually converted to scaled scores that make comparisons possible among different tests and different learners. Scaled (converted) scores are often expressed as percentiles or as age or grade equivalents. However, to say that a third grader reads at a grade level of 7 should not be interpreted to mean that this third grader has the same reading skills as an average seventh grader, since neither seventh graders nor seventh-grade reading materials will have been part of developing and norming the third-grade reading test. Raw scores might also be converted to one of several <em>standard</em> scores based on the normal distribution: Z-scores (mean 0, SD 1), T-scores (mean 50, SD 10), or stanines (mean 5, SD 2). </p>
  <a id="p428"></a>
      <h3 class="h3">Measuring Intelligence and Aptitude</h3>
          <p class="txt">Aptitude refers to a specific ability or talent; intelligence is a more general term defined in many ways: Boring&#39;s <em>what the tests test</em>; Cattell&#39;s <em>fluid</em> and <em>crystallized</em> intelligence; Sternberg&#39;s <em>successful intelligence</em>; Gardner&#39;s <em>multiple intelligences</em>; and Dweck&#39;s notion that some people view intelligence as a fixed entity (<em>fixed mindset</em>) and others as <em>incremental</em> (<em>growth mindset</em>). Growth mindsets are associated with more positive educational and life outcomes. Aptitude tests often yield measures comparable to those obtained with IQ tests. IQ is a number that corresponds to certain skills and understandings related to intelligence, but it doesn&#39;t equal intelligence. Measures of IQ might be individual (Stanford&ndash;Binet, Wechsler, or Raven&#39;s Progressive Matrices, for example) or group (the Cognitive Abilities Test, the Draw-a-Person test, or the Otis&ndash;Lennon School Ability Test). Many of these tests yield measures of different skills and aptitudes in addition to a composite IQ score. There are still many myths and controversies surrounding the measurement of intelligence. Computer-adaptive tests, which adjust their questions based on the participant&#39;s responses, are briefer and often highly effective: Evaluation of children with special needs should make accommodations that take their various individual differences into account and should be based on a comprehensive assessment program.</p>
 
     <h3 class="h3">Measuring Achievement </h3>
          <p class="txt">Standardized achievement tests might be multilevel or single age or grade level, and they might test one subject or consist of a battery of subtests covering a range of subjects. Some are traditional paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests; others are computer-adaptive tests that adjust their questions according to testee responses. Computer-adaptive tests are time consuming, demanding, and expensive to produce. However, some appear to be highly precise, efficient, and reliable. Standardized achievement tests, many of which reflect common core standards, tend to be more valid, reliable, consistent, and fairer than most teacher-made tests, and they allow for comparisons among students and comparisons with state or national standards. But they can be misinterpreted and misused.</p>

     <h3 class="h3">The Pros and Cons of High-Stakes Testing </h3>
          <p class="txt">High-stakes tests are standardized tests that have many potentially significant unintended consequences. The bulk of research and opinion concerning the uses and consequences of high-stakes tests is negative. Critics point to the tendency of high-stakes testing to narrow the curriculum (leads to the exclusion of non-core subjects such as music and art); restrict approaches to instruction (fosters an emphasis on teaching directed toward test-related material); and stifle creativity (encourages abandonment of time-consuming instructional approaches such as discovery learning and constructivism); and it is sometimes unfair for certain learners (is often difficult for ELL students and lower achievers). There is also evidence that high-stakes testing may lead to increased teacher attrition and to test-related anxiety among learners. As a result of these negative consequences, there is a national <em>opt-out movement</em> whereby some parents refuse to have their children take mandated standardized tests. Supporters suggest that high-stakes testing can increase teacher and learner motivation, improve educational standards, involve parents more closely in education, and produce learners better equipped to compete in a global environment.</p>
