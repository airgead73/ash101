    <p class="txt">When Jacoby transferred to his new school, he quickly proved the truth of this saying for the sixth-grade teacher, Mrs. Bannock.</p>

    <p class="txt">&quot;Yup,&quot; said Jacoby, &quot;I passed. I sure did. Everything. So I&#39;m in sixth grade, for sure. I promise. The thing is, I lost my report card when our house had a fire. But I promise, cross my heart, I&#39;m in sixth grade. And I can play the guitar real well. Do you want to hear? I can show you.&quot;</p>

    <p class="txt">&quot;Go ahead,&quot; said Mrs. Bannock. &quot;Play us the guitar, Jacoby.&quot;</p>
    <p class="txt">And Jacoby played. He played well, real well, just like he said.</p>
	<p class="txt">But when Jacoby had finished playing, Mrs. Bannock was not quite done. &quot;I just want to ask you a couple of questions,&quot; she said to Jacoby, flashing some geometric shapes on her computer screen.</p>
	<p class="txt">&quot;Show me which of these is an equilateral triangle,&quot; she said. &quot;How many sides does a quadrilateral have?&quot; &quot;Write 22 in Roman numerals.&quot; &quot;Show me which of these fractions are equal.&quot;</p>
	<p class="txt">But, despite his words and his promises, Jacoby couldn&#39;t perform any of these fifth-grade tasks.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are some characteristics of performance-based assessment?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">What Mrs. Bannock had done is an example of brief, performance-based assessment aligned with the fifth-grade mathematics curriculum used in her school. Like all forms of educational assessment, performance-based assessment can be used to gauge student progress and achievement.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
	 <div class="single-column">
			
		<p class="txt">But unlike many other forms of assessment, it doesn&#39;t rely on words and promises or longwinded explanations about house fires and lost assignments; instead, it asks the learner to perform, to do, to show.</p>

		<p class="txt">Broadly defined, educational assessment refers to all the formal and informal activities undertaken to gather quantitative and qualitative information about student learning and performance&mdash;and also about teachers, administrators, curriculum matters, and other measurable features of the educational enterprise.</p>

    <a id="p273"></a>
        <p class="txt">The approaches to assessment that we have looked at so far are based largely on student&#39;s responses to questions designed to assess their knowledge and their skills. In these assessments, the performances the examiner looks at are usually written or spoken responses to questions. Based on these responses, the examiner makes inferences about the learner&#39;s competence and achievements and about the effectiveness of instructional approaches.</p>

		<p class="key-point">The kinds of responses that performance-based assessment looks at are quite different: Basically, performance-based assessment evaluates student competence by looking at examples of their actual performance of the behavior being assessed.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">If the teacher wants to assess a student&#39;s knowledge of the principles that underlie writing a good essay, she does not present the student with a series of multiple-choice questions on essay writing. Instead, she asks the student to write an essay.</p>

		<p class="txt">In brief, performance-based assessment asks students to demonstrate their ability to carry out specific tasks, to create particular products, or to display a skill. For example, a performance assessment might ask learners to do the following.</p>

		<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Paint a picture in a given style.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Write a story.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Assume the role of a historical figure.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Draw a map of the school yard.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Play the ukulele.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Run 100 meters.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Debate the virtues of cats versus dogs.</li>
        </ul>
	
		<p class="txt">Clearly, performance assessment is not a recent educational innovation. But there are two fundamentally important newer aspects of its current use:</p>

		<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">Specific performance-related objectives are used as a basis for performance assessments. Having explicit learning objectives that reflect the curriculum makes it possible to align curriculum, assessment, and instruction. If an instructional objective stresses being able to perform specific tasks, create particular products, or display a given skill, a well-aligned assessment procedure would require that the learner demonstrate these accomplishments through actual performances or products.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Scoring guides, often called <em>rubrics</em>, are used to guide assessments of performances and products. Rubrics increase the validity and reliability of performance-based assessments. (Rubrics and other scoring guides are discussed later in this chapter.)</li>
        </ol>
	
		<p class="txt">Teachers use performance-based approaches to assess a wide variety of skills and achievements. These include the acquisition of concepts, oral communication skills, verbal communication skills, athletic achievements, performing arts skills, and psychomotor skills. Table 7.1 gives examples of performance assessments in each of these areas.</p>

    <h1 class="h1"><span class="sec_number">7.2</span> <span class="sec_title">Performance-Based Assessment as Authentic Assessment</span></h1>
    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">How are performance-based and authentic assessment similar? How are they different?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">The assessment of performances&mdash;as opposed to assessment based on, say, multiple-choice test items&mdash;is a highly direct form of educational assessment.</p>
	</div>
   <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">

    <p class="txt">It looks at the learner&#39;s actual performances and products. If the objective in an early elementary music class is for the students to play Brahm&#39;s lullaby, Sally would be asked to play the piece. She would then be assessed directly on her performance.</p>

    <p class="txt">Multiple-choice or other kinds of paper-and-pencil or computer-based approaches to assessment are a more indirect form of assessment. Architectural school students who take a computer-based exit test might demonstrate quite clearly that they have learned the most appropriate building materials for different purposes and that they have mastered the principles of stonework, steel construction, and wood-frame structures. But unless the test asks them to produce a blueprint, a model, or a simulation, it might tell us little about how aesthetically pleasing, functional, economically feasible, or livable the structures they eventually build might be.</p>

    <p class="txt">Asking architectural students to produce blueprints or models or to develop a computer simulation of a construction project would be a useful form of performance assessment. It would tell us more about the relevant skills and understanding that the students have developed than would a computer-based exit test.</p>

  <a id="p275"></a>
	 <p class="txt">Producing a model or a computer simulation is described as more authentic assessment. <strong>Authentic assessments</strong> are assessments that ask the learner to perform tasks that approximate real-life situations and demands as closely as possible. Its supporters argue that this type of assessment is more real and more useful; hence the label <em>authentic assessment</em>. Asking architectural students to build a house would be an example of assessment that is highly authentic. But of course, authentic assessment of this kind is not always feasible.</p>
     </div>
	 
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Examples of Authentic Assessment</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">In schools, however, authentic&mdash;or relatively authentic&mdash;assessment is often possible (clearly, the authenticity of assessments can vary considerably). Any performance assessment that reflects real-world applications can be authentic.</p>
	</div>
	<figure class="photo-right"> <img src="images/7.1.jpg" alt="Boy presenting a report in front of his class. " title="Boy presenting a report in front of his class. " id="img7.1"/>
        <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">Comstock/Stockbyte/Getty Images Plus</p>
          <p class="caption">Assessment is authentic to the extent that it reflects the demands and constraints of real-world situations. If one of this teacher&#39;s learning targets is that students become eloquent and motivating public speakers, the situation shown can be a relatively authentic instructional and assessment strategy. Speaking in front of the entire school might be even more authentic.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
	
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">For example, speaking eloquently in front of a large group is a skill that depends somewhat on size of vocabulary, clear enunciation, adequate volume, and of course, having something to say&mdash;preferably something fascinating and surprising. A teacher might measure some of these factors with a series of formal and informal tests and observations. But it is highly unlikely that these measures would yield useful information about how fluently the individual might speak in public. These tests would simply not be an authentic measure of the examinee&#39;s eloquence. For this purpose, only a performance-based assessment is likely to be authentic.</p>
	
    <p class="key-point">However, although the most authentic school assessments are usually performance based, authentic assessment and performance-based assessment are not synonymous expressions.</p>

	<p class="txt">Authentic assessments look at the learner&#39;s ability to perform tasks and display skills in situations as similar as possible to those that might be encountered in real life.</p>

	<p class="txt">An example of the use of real-life performances in authentic assessment is provided by Kaider, Hains-Wesson, and Young&#39;s (2017) description of how it is possible to integrate learning and assessment activities in technological programs designed to develop employable skills such as welding, construction, X-ray technology, and so on. When a welding student is assessed according to minimum performance criteria on her ability to actually perform two clearly defined and fundamentally important welding processes on an actual job site, the assessment is authentic.</p>

  <a id="p276"></a>
	<p class="txt">Although, by definition, performance assessments look at student&#39;s performance of the behaviors that are actually being tested, the testing situations can sometimes be quite artificial rather than authentic.</p>
	
	<p class="key-point">The difference between the two has to do with the extent to which performance settings approximate real-life settings.</p>

   <p class="txt">Thus, asking Zach and each of his classmates in turn to demonstrate how to plant trees using a tiny replica of a seedling, a pail, and a trowel might be a valuable form of performance assessment. But it would not be nearly as <em>authentic</em> as taking Zach and his classmates out to a recently lumbered mountain slope, giving each of them a bundle of seedlings and a planting shovel, and having them actually perform tree planting. Unfortunately, as noted earlier, the most authentic assessments are not always practical.</p>
   </div>
   </div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Comparisons With Traditional Assessment</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The expression <strong>alternative assessment</strong> is also often used in assessment literature. This refers to any form of assessment other than the more traditional approaches represented by paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests, most of which are objective multiple-choice tests.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Performance-based assessment requires that educators be able to express in concrete examples and explicit definitions the actual levels and standards of performance that demonstrate competence and achievement (Potter, Ernst, &#38; Glennie, 2017).</p>

	<p class="txt">The assumption is that assessments involving actual performances are more meaningful than traditional approaches to assessment. They provide a more direct form of assessment and are thus closer to real life. As we saw, they are more likely to be authentic assessments. In contrast, traditional measures are typically a more indirect form of measurement and are less likely to be authentic.</p>

	<p class="txt">As an example of the distinction between traditional and performance assessments, a conventional multiple-choice test might reveal very clearly and emphatically that Alisha can identify and knows the differences between a variety of forceps, clamps, scalpels, scissors, and needle holders. But this test would not demonstrate that she actually knows how to use these instruments to perform an appendectomy. There is a big difference between naming and describing the uses of surgical instruments and actually performing surgery.</p>

	<p class="txt">If we are to evaluate Alisha&#39;s skills as a surgeon, we should probably let her carve a vermiform appendix out of a dummy, conduct virtual surgery with a computer-based simulator, or perform a closely supervised appendectomy on a real patient. Note how each of these approaches to assessment reflects a different level of authenticity&mdash;that is, a different level of similarity to real-life situations and demands. Table 7.2 includes more examples that clarify distinctions between performance-based and more traditional approaches to assessment.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">Although performance-based assessment is often contrasted with more traditional approaches to assessment, both have identical purposes in education.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">Specifically, as we have stated several times, the most important purpose of assessment is formative: It is designed to improve and foster student learning. A second important purpose is summative: It provides information that summarizes learner progress and achievement and that serves as an important basis for grading (discussed in Chapter 11).</p>

<a id="p278"></a>
	<p class="txt">The important point is that performance-based assessment, like more traditional approaches, can be used for both summative and formative purposes. For example, individual musical performances that are the basis for assessments in a music class might reveal certain weaknesses that provide the teacher with suggestions for helping the learner master required skills&mdash;a formative function. At the same time, when the performance is rated according to specific guidelines, it provides the teacher with a verbal descriptor or a numerical score (or both) that can be used to arrive at the learner&#39;s grade&mdash;a summative function (Table 7.3).</p>

    <p class="txt">Put another way, if the important goals of the educational endeavor include helping students become autonomous, motivated, thinking learners and develop into accomplished, well-rounded artists, moral citizens, skilled athletes, or brilliant public speakers, then we absolutely need assessment procedures that look at the extent to which these goals are being met.</p>

<a id="p279"></a>
    <p class="key-point">In many ways performance-based assessments come closer than traditional assessments to tapping many of the competencies that define our educational objectives.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">In addition, they are often more representative of the demands and constraints of the real world. Therefore, they are marked by a higher degree of what assessment specialists describe as authenticity.</p>
   
	<p class="txt">One of the many benefits of performance-based assessments is that they serve exceptionally well as assessment <em>for</em> learning rather than simply as assessment <em>of</em> learning.</p>

    <p class="key-point">Having a learner prepare a performance and execute it can be a highly meaningful and memorable learning experience.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">Another benefit is that learners are often collaborators in performance assessment. Along with the teacher, they determine the criteria for acceptable, outstanding, or less-than-adequate performances.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Thus, learners become active participants not only in their own learning but also in their own assessment.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">And, as noted previously, the self-assessment skills that are reflected in learners&#39; awareness of their cognitive processes (their metacognitive skills), together with their ability to select objectives and to monitor and direct their activities toward these objectives, are basic to becoming self-regulated learners. These are highly motivated learners who have learned how to learn (see <em>In the Classroom: Developing Self-Regulated Learners</em>).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">In the Classroom: Developing Self-Regulated Learners</h3>
        <p class="txt">How are learners to be made more aware of their own mental processes? How are teachers to foster the development of their metacognitive skills&mdash;skills that are basic to becoming autonomous, self-regulated learners?</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Approaches to assessment and instruction play a key role in this area. If one of our broad educational goals is to develop independent thinkers&mdash;those who set their own goals and objectives and who monitor, direct, and evaluate their own learning activities&mdash;then we have to provide opportunities for them to engage in these activities. In the classroom, this means teachers must focus on activities such as the following.</p>

		<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Encourage self-reflection&mdash;perhaps through the use of portfolios, diaries, blogs, or other ways of recording thoughts and ideas.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Integrate formative assessments into instructional and learning procedures to provide learners with feedback they can use to determine their progress, thereby fostering self-assessment.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Use assessment strategies that recognize and accommodate differences among learners&mdash;for example, include assessments based on psychomotor and affective responses in addition to, or sometimes instead of, those that tap only cognitive processes.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Give students many opportunities to manage some of their own learning&mdash;for example, frequently allow them to decide what, how, and when they will study, read, learn, or do; and perhaps equally important, how they will assess their progress toward what they have chosen as their learning objectives. There is evidence, for example, that allowing and supporting independent study fosters self-regulated learning (Ambreen, Haqdad, &#38; Saleem, 2016).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Allow learners to become important and effective collaborators in the business of teaching and learning&mdash;for example, by allowing them meaningful input into the development of instructional objectives, related assessments, and learning media.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Make use of digital technologies for learning and assessment. As Yang and Huang (2016) found following a survey of more than 44,000 Chinese students, net generation learners whose exposure to Internet-based technology was greatest had significantly more positive attitudes toward online participation. The study suggests that today&#39;s learners are, to a large extent, attuned to web-based learning. However, caution O&#39;Connell and Dyment (2016), not all students are as technologically competent as is widely assumed. In their investigation of how ready and anxious students are to use Web 2.0 technologies, O&#39;Connell and Dyment found that whether students choose to use digital technologies is highly influenced by whether they think the educational tasks in question are &quot;good.&quot; Some learners use only the most basic technologies like word processing&mdash;and only because they view the technology as the easiest way of completing an assignment. Also, keep in mind that simply because a course or an assessment is web-based, that does not guarantee it is well aligned with educational goals or that it reflects the best practices for either assessment or instruction.</li>
        </ul>

  	 <div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Apart from the benefits and advantages of performance-based assessments, some practical considerations often mandate their use. For example, children&#39;s verbal skills in the early grades are often inadequate for more formal and traditional paper-and-pencil or computer-based tests. As a result, the use of these sorts of tests is relatively rare in the lower grades.</p>
   
	<p class="txt">Similarly, traditional testing is often impossible or, at the very least, inadequate and unfair for learners with special needs, as well as for ELL students&mdash;and the population of ELL students is only increasing year over year (see Figure 7.1). In addition, even in the absence of language or competency constraints, performance assessments are often better than many of the more traditional assessments in measuring the skills and competencies for which schools strive. Figure 7.2 summarizes the advantages of performance-based assessment.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the main requirements for good performance-based assessment?</span></h2>   	
	</div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
  <p class="intro">From the educator&#39;s viewpoint, two of the most important requirements for performance assessment are<br/><br/>
  1. a learning objective that can be expressed in terms of a specific performance task, and<br/>
  2. a clear set of guidelines&mdash;termed a <em>rubric</em>&mdash;for assessing the performance task.
    </p>
  
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
  
	<div class="single-column">

	

    <p class="key-point">However, even when an instructional objective suggests a specific performance that can be evaluated, not all possible performances provide good assessments.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">For example, a performance assessment of the skills of school athletes trying out for the triathlon team might involve having them engage in several different kinds of performances, such as the following:</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">a timed run around the gym or around the perimeter of the football field</li>
          <li class="li_text">a two-lap swim in the school&#39;s pool</li>
          <li class="li_text">a bicycle sprint around the block</li>
          <li class="li_text">a timed change of clothing from swimming to cycling gear</li>
       </ul>

    <p class="txt">Based on each athlete&#39;s combined achievements on these four performance tasks, the coach might then select team members for further training. However, these performance-based assessments may not be ideal if they do not meet the following conditions.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Suitability</h2>
	<div class="single-column"> 
	<p class="txt">As Figure 7.3 shows, a wide variety of tasks might be used for performance-based assessment in schools. However, many of these are more suitable for some instructional objectives than for others. For example, activities like running a triathlon require a combination of skills that can easily be described in terms of specific physical performance tasks: running, swimming, and cycling.</p>

    <p class="key-point">Yet not all learning tasks and targets can be so easily represented by specific performances.</p>

	<p class="txt">Thus, although abstract reasoning skills might be demonstrated in actual performances, they are often better assessed with more traditional tests of abstract reasoning.</p>

          <p class="caption">Performance-based assessments ask learners to produce or perform what the teacher wants to assess. They are a highly motivating, student-centered form of assessment, more often used as assessment for rather than of learning.

	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Similarly, although various kinds of performance-based assessments might be used as an indication of learners&#39; understanding and recollection of the historical facts they have studied, a paper-and-pencil or computer-based test is likely to be more efficient and more informative. Asking learners to develop and present scenarios depicting relevant historical events might be a worthwhile assessment approach with important motivational consequences, but it is a complex and time-consuming endeavor. Presenting them with a series of questions on these historical events is likely to reveal the breadth and depth of their understanding far more clearly and efficiently.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

	<h2 class="h2">Generalizability</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="key-point">The generalizability of a performance-based assessment is closely related to how representative of real-life situations the performance tasks are. Generalizability is among the most important criteria for the use of performance-based assessment.</p>

	<p class="txt">In the case of the triathlon example, for instance, the coach needs to ask, &quot;How likely is it that those with the fastest average times on these three tasks will ultimately be the best triathletes in the school?&quot;</p>

    <p class="txt">Although the task of selecting candidates for triathlon training seems ideally suited to a performance-based approach to assessment, issues concerning the generalizability of the assessment may completely invalidate the results. It is quite possible that there may be little correspondence between the performance tasks selected and the requirements of an actual Olympic-distance triathlon. Running around a football field at blazing speed, torpedoing through two laps of the pool, streaking around the block on a bicycle, and changing shoes in jig time may say very little about the student&#39;s ability to swim 1.5 kilometers, cycle 40 kilometers, and run 10 kilometers.</p>
	
  <a id="p284"></a>
    <p class="txt">For instance, say that Georgiou is an incredible runner and cyclist, but he cannot swim much more than two laps; doing so almost kills him. Antonne, on the other hand, cannot run or cycle nearly as fast as Georgiou, but he can easily swim a mile without tiring. Scoring their relative performances so that the results would be generalizable to an actual Olympic-distance triathlon would be very difficult. And if, because of his cycling and running prowess, Georgiou were to be selected and Antonne rejected, would that be fair?</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Fairness</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">The criterion of fairness asks, &quot;Do the required performances treat all students impartially and equally?&quot; Issues of fairness are important in all forms of assessment. However, they are easily overlooked.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">Performance assessments of early reading skills, for example, need to consider factors such as the child&#39;s language background. Performance-based measures of early literacy are likely to favor those whose dominant home language is the language of instruction, and they may well be unfair for the nearly 10 percent of U.S. students who are ELL (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016a). As Rosa (2017) argues, &quot;Performance-based assessments must be culturally responsive in order to truly serve the needs of students from all backgrounds&quot; (p. 55).</p>

    <p class="txt">Similarly, to be fair to all learners, performance-based assessments need to take personality characteristics into account. On measures that require public performances, learners who are bold and outgoing may well outperform their more timid peers even when both learners have very similar competencies and achievements.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">Also, it might be important to take learning styles and learning preferences into account. As Iannone and Simpson (2012) found, performance-based assessments in mathematics may be unfair for some learners who perform better on written than oral tasks. On the other hand, it may be that performance-based school assessments, particularly those that are most authentic (most similar to real-life constraints and demands), are better predictors of future success and, by the same token, more valid and more just. Clearly, however, not all performance-based assessments are fair for all learners.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Practical Considerations</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="key-point">Performance-based assessment is often constrained by any of a number of important practical considerations, such as cost, time involved, equipment required, and demands on both teacher and learner.</p>

	<p class="txt">For example, although hands-on, performance-based assessments of scientific concepts and inquiry skills (such as having learners conduct original experiments) provide highly authentic measures, they are seldom used. These sorts of performance-based assessments are constrained by difficulties related to implementing them, including the financial costs and time required. For assessments of this kind, educational technologies reflected in web-based courses and computer-adaptive testing may provide better ways of approaching both formative and summative assessment.</p>
	</div>
	
  <a id="p285"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Rubrics and Scoring</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="key-point">Performance-based assessments are not always easy to score.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">An important consideration for the teacher concerns whether it is possible to develop a clear set of guidelines for assessing a task, and whether these guidelines lend themselves to objective, meaningful, and fair scoring procedures.</p>

	<p class="txt">Guidelines often take the form of what are termed <em>rubrics</em>. A rubric is a written set of procedures and instructions for assessing a product or a performance. Scoring guides can also take the form of <em>checklists and rating scales</em>. These, along with rubrics, are discussed in more detail in later sections of this chapter (see Figure 7.4).</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead"> 
    <p class="intro">As noted earlier, performance-based assessments can be used to serve either or both of the two principal purposes of educational assessment:<br/><br/>
	&#8226;  formative purposes, in which the assessment is integrated into instruction and is intended to provide feedback for both teachers and learners with a view to improving learning; or<br/>
	&#8226;  summative purposes, in which the assessment is used mainly to summarize student competency and achievement, often in the form of a grade.
	</p> 	
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">
	
    <p class="txt">No matter which of these purposes performance-based assessment is intended to serve, the following sequential steps can be highly helpful in their planning and development.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Step 1: Decide on the Main Purpose of the Assessment</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt">The first step in developing performance-based assessment is to decide how the assessment is to be used. Is it mainly to inform instruction and enhance student learning (formative function), or will its primary usefulness be as a basis for grading (summative)?</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Performance-Based Assessment for Formative Purposes</h3>

    <p class="txt">Performance-based assessments whose purpose is formative are likely to involve learners more closely in the selection of learning objectives and in various details of the assessment process. Student involvement in assessment can be highly motivating, explain Barlowe and Cook (2016). They describe a coalition of educators&mdash;basically a PLC&mdash;from 38 public high schools in New York who have avoided the use of high-stakes tests, collaborating instead on the development of a variety of performance-based assessments. This approach, they claim, has resulted in high levels of student engagement.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">Also useful for student engagement are web-learning tools and various online approaches to instruction (Farrel et al., 2018; Irby, Borda, &#38; Haupt, 2018). The web-learning tools often used include <strong>blogs</strong> (literally, <em>web logs</em>), <strong>wikis</strong> (collaborative knowledge-based websites), social networking sites, and <strong>podcasts</strong> (downloadable video, audio, or text files). Using these technologies can encourage learners&#39; creativity, information sharing, and motivation. Most of these resources can be used by learners to generate products that then become the basis for performance-based assessment. A sample of web-based resources for students and teachers is included in the feature titled <em>In the Classroom: Web 2.0 Tools&mdash;and Beyond</em> in Chapter 3.</p>

	<p class="txt">Performance-based assessments are also often structured so that they are likely to reveal deficits, misconceptions, and learning challenges, and therefore they serve a useful formative function. For example, a popular performance-based method of assessing a child&#39;s reading level is called the <strong>running record</strong>. Basically, a running record is the result of having the child read a passage from a <em>benchmark</em> book in which certain words are indicative of the child&#39;s reading level. The examiner (teacher), who has a list of these critical words, listens to the child reading, checks off those words that are correct, and notes errors. Typically, marking a running record requires that the examiner note the nature of errors committed (substituting one word for another; omitting a word; inserting a word), instances of self-correction, word repetitions, instances when the child has to be asked to try again, and so on.</p>

<a id="p287"></a>
	<p class="txt">A running record assessment is a highly formative tool. It not only indicates whether the child is reading at, below, or above an expected level but also indicates the nature of the child&#39;s most common errors. Accordingly, it provides direction for remediation (Gillett &#38; Ellingson, 2017).</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Performance-Based Assessment for Summative Purposes</h3>
	<p class="txt">From the teacher&#39;s perspective, the main difference between performance-based assessment designed mainly for summative rather than formative purposes is that summative assessment requires a definite, clear, representative, valid, and reliable scoring system. In contrast, assessment for formative purposes does not need to provide a score or a grade: The most important requirement is that it must provide feedback to enhance the teaching&#8211;learning process.</p>

	<p class="txt">Not surprisingly, performance-based assessments that are intended to be a basis for grading are more likely to be developed mainly by teachers. But in many instances collaboration with learners can serve important instructional and motivational functions. Also, collaboration among educators within schools and even across school districts and states, often in the form of PLCs, has become an increasingly common approach to developing summative performance tests (e.g., Barlowe &#38; Cook, 2016).</p>

	<p class="txt">In some areas, such as the performing arts and athletics, performance-based summative assessments are the rule rather than the exception. Musical, acting, artistic, or athletic competencies and achievements are not easily measured with paper-and-pencil or computer-based multiple-choice tests and quizzes. In these areas, performance-based assessments are sometimes made available for statewide use (for example in Virginia: Abbott, 2016).</p>

	<p class="txt">As we will see later, however, although performance-based assessments are clearly appropriate for summative assessments in these areas, they do have some limitations and weaknesses. Chief among them are problems associated with lack of validity and reliability, often due to inconsistencies among different examiners (Sebok, Roy, Klinger, &#38; De Champlain, 2015; Yang, Oosterhof, &#38; Xia, 2015). Development of detailed scoring guides and adherence to them can do much to alleviate these problems.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Step 2: Establish Learning Objectives</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt">Learning (or instructional) objectives are the intended and desired outcomes of the educational process for units of instruction. Educational goals or standards are broader educational objectives. Thus, while learning objectives reflect educational goals, they are far more specific. In the <em>backward-design</em> approach to curriculum planning, educational goals are essential for developing curriculum content and emphases. However, they are less directly related to the day-to-day business of teaching and assessing than are explicit learning objectives.</p>

<a id="p288"></a>
    <p class="txt">Important learning objectives are generally not determined solely by classroom teachers. Rather, in almost all schools, they are a fundamental feature of the curriculum adopted by the school system. In fact, curricula and related instructional objectives are often common to entire states or even common across states. Typically, these common standards apply from kindergarten through 12th grade and cover language arts and literacy, mathematics, and sometimes science (e.g., New York State Education, 2017).</p>
	
    <p class="txt">It is important for teachers to develop a clear understanding of the instructional objectives that are implicit (or sometimes explicit) in the mandated curriculum and in descriptions of common core standards. Clearly understood instructional objectives are basic to good assessment and instruction.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Step 3: Select Performance Tasks</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt">Performance tasks specify what learners must do in performance-based assessment. These tasks can be highly specific. To determine whether Juan can count to 100 by tens, the teacher need only ask him to do so. Highly specific performance tasks usually involve precise directions or instructions that result in very uniform learner responses.</p>

	<p class="txt">Performance tasks can also be much more general. Even a simple, straightforward objective such as being able to count to 100 by tens might lend itself to a more general approach. For example, the teacher and students might set up a little store containing various items whose price tags vary from $1 to $100. Learners can then earn or are given different denominations of fake money. Students&#39; performances as they buy and sell items would then reveal who knows number names and count sequences, who can count to tell the number of objects, who can compare numbers, who can count by tens, and so on. (See Table 7.4.)</p>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">Highly explicit tasks are easier to develop and can more easily be directed at specific instructional objectives. Also, because they usually take the form of precise questions or directions that lead to predictable responses, it is easier to develop scoring guides for them.</p>

	<p class="txt">More general performance tasks have the disadvantage of being more complex and more time consuming. In addition, they do not always lead to performances that can easily be assessed in relation to instructional objectives. Nor is it always possible to develop explicit scoring guides for them. However, they can have some clear advantages, not the least of which are their motivational and instructional benefits. Perhaps Juan will learn something from being asked to count to 100 by tens (a highly specific performance task), and perhaps he won&#39;t. But he may well learn some surprising and unexpected things from trying to calculate how he and Gaia can pool their resources to purchase things that cost way more than $100.</p>

	<p class="txt">As Figure 7.3 shows, a wide variety of products and performances are appropriate for performance-based assessments. Products may take the form of journals, essays, drawings, models, stories, or various web-based creations such as blogs or wikis. Performances might include musical recitals, athletic performances, debates, auditions, demonstrations, and so on. These events might occur in front of a group, or they might be performed only for the examiner.</p>

	<p class="txt">When selecting or developing a performance task, teachers need to keep a number of considerations in mind. These are reflected in the following five questions:</p>

		<ol class="nl">
				<li class="li_text">Does the performance task reflect learning objectives? Time-consuming activities such as having learners prepare portfolios, design maps, or create models do not always tap the most important instructional objectives.</li>
				<li class="li_text">Even if the performance task is well aligned with instructional objectives, is it worth the time and effort required to complete it? If a complex and elaborate performance task serves no important instructional or motivational purposes, a simpler task might be a better choice.</li>
				<li class="li_text">Is it possible to develop scoring criteria for the task? Not only must it be possible to develop scoring criteria, but the criteria need to be fair, valid, and reliable measures of skills and competencies that represent instructional objectives.</li>
				<li class="li_text">Is the task as authentic as possible? Performance tasks that most closely reflect real-world demands and constraints are likely to be more useful and more valid measures than less authentic tasks. In general, authentic tasks are more likely to be predictive of success on similar non-school-based tasks. As we saw in Chapter 2, predictive validity is an important feature of school assessment. For example, if 12th-grade assessments have predictive validity, a high 12th-grade exit score should predict success in postsecondary academic endeavors. Similarly, an &quot;exceeds standard&quot; rating through first-grade reading performance assessments should predict a happy time in second grade.</li>
				<li class="li_text">Is the task feasible within available resources? Even if a performance tasks meets all the criteria for good performance-based assessment, it may be too expensive, too time consuming, or too demanding of cognitive or physical resources.</li>
		</ol>

<a id="p290"></a>
	<h2 class="h2">Step 4: Develop a Scoring System</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt">As we saw earlier, establishing clear instructional objectives is fundamental to good educational assessment. But perhaps equally important for performance-based assessment, the teacher, often in collaboration with colleagues and sometimes with learners, needs to establish the criteria that will be used to judge performance tasks.</p>

    <p class="txt"><strong>Performance criteria</strong> specify the characteristics of the performances and products that are required for different assessments. Imagine, for example, how you might assess the performance of your vehicle. You might ask: Does it always start? Does it steer properly? Are the brakes adequate? Do all the gauges always work? Does it use more fuel than expected? Does it require a lot of repairs?</p>
	
    <p class="txt">These questions are examples of performance criteria. In much the same way, a teacher might ask of second grader Millicent: Can she read common second-grade words? Does she understand what she is reading? Does she use skills and strategies to decode unfamiliar words? These questions imply what the teacher thinks the criteria of good second-grade reading are. But to be useful in a performance-based assessment, the criteria need to be made even more specific. For example, they need to specify how many of the common second-grade words Millicent must read and understand to meet an acceptable standard. They also need to describe the kind of performance on each criterion that will be considered to exceed or to be below the expected standard.</p>

	<p class="txt">Figure 7.5 presents an example of part of an array of scoring criteria for one objective in kindergarten mathematics. The scoring criteria shown are an example of an element of a <em>rubric</em>&mdash;an explicit, written guide for assessing a performance or a product in performance-based assessment.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="q">How do you go about developing a rubric for performance tasks?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">Among the pervasive problems in educational assessment is the fact that many of the things we need to measure are very complex.</p>
  
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">

	  <div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Determining whether first graders know the alphabet or whether second graders have learned how to add three numbers is relatively simple: We can request that they recite their ABCs, or we can ask them, &quot;Hey, what is 2 plus 6 plus 3?&quot; But assessing the extent to which they can read fluently or evaluating the clarity of their thought processes is quite another matter.</p>

    <p class="txt">For both of these educational assessments&mdash;and many others&mdash;we are likely to require students to perform or demonstrate what they can do.</p>

	<p class="key-point">But unless we are careful, the evaluations that result from these performances might be so subjective as to be of little value.</p>

    <p class="txt">And if that is the case, as Trace, Janssen, and Meier (2017) found when they looked at the ratings four different examiners gave for 524 second-language essays, we will often disagree with each other when we evaluate our learners. In measurement terms, our assessments will lack validity and reliability. Moreover, they may be biased and unfair and of little worth if we want to generalize from them.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Analytic and Holistic Rubrics</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">One way to make assessment of performances more objective, reliable, and valid is to use carefully developed guidelines on which we can agree. Rubrics, such as the one shown in Figure 7.5, are a way of expressing these guidelines.</p>
        
	<p class="key-point">Rubrics specify the criteria and the standards that might be used to assess a performance.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">In addition, most rubrics include a scale that denotes different levels of achievement or competence. For example, the criteria that make up a rubric might be scaled from <em>poor</em> to <em>excellent</em> or from <em>does not meet standard</em> to <em>exceeds standard</em>, with a number of steps in between.</p>
        
	<p class="key-point">The rubric thus communicates to the learner precisely what is required for performance at successive levels of excellence.</p>

	<p class="txt">A distinction is sometimes made between two different kinds of rubrics in terms of the scores and information they yield. The <strong>holistic rubric</strong> is designed to yield a single, global assessment; the <strong>analytic rubric</strong> may also provide an overall score, but it is purposely designed to yield scores or ratings for different aspects of the performance.</p>
        
	<p class="txt">A holistic rubric often consists of a single criterion with which to assess a performance, thus resulting in a global score or rating. As a result, holistic rubrics often take the form of a paragraph or even just one sentence, describing a standard of acceptable performance. An example of a simple holistic rubric would be &quot;The student will be able to recite the alphabet correctly within 55 seconds.&quot;</p>

<a id="p292"></a>
	<p class="txt">Analytic rubrics typically provide a list of criteria by which a performance can be assessed as well as detailed guidelines for evaluating performance. They typically take the form of a two-dimensional grid, as shown in Figure 7.7, where rows represent criteria and columns are used to describe levels of performance relative to each criterion.</p>
        
	<p class="txt">A two-dimensional, grid-type rubric can also be used in a holistic sense whereby, instead of giving a rating for each criterion, the examiner weighs the relative ratings on each to arrive at a single score or rating. When using the rubric in an analytic sense, the examiner assigns a rating relative to each criterion and might, or might not, determine an overall rating. For example, a sixth-grade teacher using the essay scoring rubric shown in Figure 7.7 will evaluate each learner&#39;s essay on all six criteria. Every criterion will be assigned a numerical score between 1 and 4, reflecting the student&#39;s performance. When using the rubric in an analytic sense, the teacher will communicate a separate rating for each of the six criteria shown. When using the same rubric in a holistic manner, the teacher will calculate a single rating or score determined by assigning a weighting to each criterion. If focusing on the main topic is more important than having a good introduction, it is given more weighting in arriving at an overall assessment. (For an example of a ready-to-use, free, public rubric, see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.rcampus.com/rubricshowc.cfm?code&#61;A36CAW&#38;sp&#61;yes&#38;">https://www.rcampus.com/rubricshowc.cfm?code&#61;A36CAW&#38;sp&#61;yes&#38;</a>.)</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Note that the final step in this process is developing a scoring system. Basically, this step involves identifying and refining criteria that can be used to assess the performance of a task or the quality of a product.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Identifying Criteria</h3>	

	<p class="txt">Say, for example, that you want to devise a performance-based assessment task for essay writing in a sixth-grade class. First you need to know the criteria for a good essay. A variety of approaches are possible: You might begin by researching published material, online or hard copy, and ferreting around for information about how your state, your school, or other authorities define the qualities of a good sixth-grade essay. You might also look at the pile of sixth-grade essays you or others have collected over the years and analyze them, trying to discover what makes some better than others. Or, better yet, why not spearhead the formation of a PLC so that you can consult and collaborate with other educators and perhaps even with parents and students? What do others think the characteristics of a good essay are? Why?</p>

	<p class="txt">In the end, you might come up with a list of criteria that looks something like this:</p>

	<p class="ext"><em>A good sixth grade essay:</em></p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text"><em>focuses on its main topic</em></li>
          <li class="li_text"><em>is interesting and clearly written</em></li>
          <li class="li_text"><em>uses appropriate vocabulary and grammar</em></li>
          <li class="li_text"><em>has a good introduction</em></li>
          <li class="li_text"><em>is logically sequenced</em></li>
          <li class="li_text"><em>contains material that is demonstrably factual or opinions that are identified as such</em></li>
    </ul>

<a id="p293"></a>
	<p class="txt">Note that these simplified criteria reflect important common core standards that might be adopted by a state or a school jurisdiction.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Refining Criteria</h3>
    <p class="txt">Once you have determined the most important general criteria of a good sixth-grade essay, you then need to refine these criteria. This means analyzing them and breaking them down into distinct, qualitatively different, sequential categories. Simply put, if <em>focuses on its main topic</em> is an important criterion, you now need to be able to identify the specific features of an essay that make it an exceptionally good example of focusing on the main topic. And you also need to know the features of essays that barely meet your standards or that are below them.</p>

	<p class="txt">Say, for example, that your assessment scale is the 4-point scale that is often used for performance-based assessments: 4 = exceeds standard; 3 = meets standard; 2 = approaches standard; and 1 = below standard. Now you need to describe as precisely as you can what features you will look for in categorizing an essay as a 1, 2, 3, or 4 based on each of your criteria. You are now in position to develop a rubric for assessing sixth-grade essays (see the example in Figure 7.7).</p>

	<p class="key-point">Rubrics of this kind can be useful for students as well as for teachers.

Some, like the one in Figure 7.8&mdash;a scoring rubric for creative writing in third grade&mdash;are somewhat simpler and easier to develop. While they can be useful, these rubrics are not as precise as the matrix shown in Figure 7.7. They provide little information about the criteria that define each of the four categories of grades.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How are rubrics, checklists, and rating scales related?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">Closely related to assessment rubrics are <span class="txt_bold">checklists</span> and <span class="txt_bold">rating scales</span>. In fact, many rubrics contain one or even both of these tools as part of their scoring guides.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
	
	<h2 class="h2">Checklists</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	  <p class="txt">Checklists are lists of the elements or components of a performance that are important for successful execution of a task. Unlike the criteria that define rubrics, checklists are typically composed of nonsequential items that do not attempt to assess the quality of the work.</p>

<a id="p296"></a>
	  <p class="txt">For example, the rubric presented in Figure 7.9 is based on a scale of excellence ranging from <em>beginning</em> to <em>exemplary</em>. In contrast, a checklist does not contain a scale indicating the types of behaviors that qualify for different evaluative judgments.</p>

      <p class="key-point">Instead, it often consists entirely of a list of elements that the teacher might look for in a performance. In this sense, a checklist is normally much simpler than a rubric.</p>

	  <p class="txt">A checklist is ordinarily made up of an unordered list of criteria, with spaces provided to indicate whether each criterion has been met. For example, a checklist having to do with writing a classical English sonnet might contain items such as these.</p>

	  <p class="ext"><em>___Yes ___No&ensp;&ensp;Is written in iambic pentameter<br/>
			___Yes ___No&ensp;&ensp;Has 14 lines<br/>
			___Yes ___No&ensp;&ensp;Has the rhyme scheme ABABCDCDEFEFGG<br/>
			___Yes ___No&ensp;&ensp;Tells a sensible story</em></p>

	<p class="txt">Each of these criteria can simply be marked as yes or no. However, the last item on the checklist can also be assessed on a scale, such as <em>Very, Not so much, and No</em>. For these sorts of checklist items, it is possible to develop a scale that can be translated into a more precise assessment.</p>

For example, Figure 7.11 presents a sample checklist that a kindergarten teacher developed to look at the social and emotional development of her charges over the course of a year. (She also uses similar checklists to monitor physical development, language development, and creative development.) Children are assessed with respect to each item on the list on three occasions: at the beginning of the school year, in the spring, and again at the end of the year. Information gathered from these performance-based developmental assessments can provide useful information for parents and teachers.</p>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Rating Scales</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Checklists typically tell us whether a behavior, a characteristic, or a performance has been observed. Often, however, it is possible&mdash;and more informative&mdash;to indicate the degree to which an observed performance conforms to a criterion. Rating scales allow examiners to do just that. A rating scale provides a way of ranking observations in quantitative or qualitative terms&mdash;or both. In effect, a rating scale indicates the degree to which a criterion is being met.</p>

	 <p class="key-point">Most rubrics contain rating scales.</p>

	<p class="txt">For example, the rubric shown in Figure 7.7 uses a common rating scale that is both verbal (qualitative) and numerical (quantitative). Verbal rankings range from <em>below standard</em> through <em>approaches standard, meets standard</em>, and <em>exceeds standard</em>. Corresponding numerical rankings range from 1 through 4. Similarly, the rubric in Figure 7.8 is based on letter-grade rankings (A, B, C, and D), with corresponding verbal descriptors (<em>excellent, good, average</em>, and <em>below average</em>); and that shown in Figure 7.9 uses four verbal descriptors: <em>beginning, developing, accomplished</em>, and <em>exemplary</em>.</p>

<a id="p299"></a>
	<p class="txt">When the meanings of the rankings are clear, rating scales can help learners and parents understand instructional objectives more clearly. They can also suggest areas of weakness and provide direction for improving learning.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Uses of Rubrics, Checklists, and Rating Scales</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Rubrics, checklists, and rating scales are often given to learners at the beginning of an instructional sequence. They can be very useful for clarifying learning objectives and directing learner efforts (El Turkey et al., 2018). When Jones, Allen, Dunn, and Brooker (2017) encouraged students to use rubrics as a tool for learning and self-evaluation, the results were highly positive in terms of student engagement and achievement.</p>

	<p class="txt">One of the important advantages of using a rubric is that it allows for more consistent and fairer performance-based assessment. For example, Cankoy and Ozder (2017) report that agreement among raters who were asked to assess the problem-posing skills of primary school students was significantly higher with a rubric designed for this purpose than without. Similarly, Simper (2018) developed a rubric designed to assess changes in cognitive skills. An initial pilot study found that the rubric had high validity and reliability.</p>

	<p class="txt">Rubrics are especially useful in evaluating portfolios and other kinds of performances and products. As Smith (2017) notes, it is extremely difficult to evaluate some performances, particularly in areas that require judgment of creative products or actions. Teachers faced with having to assess a student&#39;s writing, drawing, acting, or bongo drum playing may well be much like the person who says, &quot;Well, I really don&#39;t know much about art (or bongo drums or acting or. . .), but I know what I like&quot;&mdash;and judges accordingly. As a result, different teachers&#39; assessments are often all over the map. But, argues Smith (2017), using a carefully prepared rubric to evaluate student performances removes much of the subjectivity that might otherwise characterize the process. Assessment in accordance with clearly defined criteria makes assigning grades or evaluative comments simpler and more transparent, and it also ensures that assessments are more consistent and fairer.</p>

	<p class="txt">Rubrics vary considerably in detail and form, and they can be difficult and time consuming to develop. However, many examples of rubrics are easily found with a quick Internet search. Most rubrics share the following characteristics.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">They specify in writing the final objective or standard that serves as a goal for an instructional sequence and that will be evident in a performance or product.</li>
          <li class="li_text">They include a scale that represents a ranking of behaviors, performances, skills, or products for use in assessing the extent to which student performance matches the final goal.</li>

  <div class="section-lead">
  
   <p class="intro">There are many different approaches to performance-based assessment. These include <span class="txt_bold">developmental assessments, demonstrations, exhibitions,</span> and portfolios (discussed in Section 7.9).</p>
   
   </div>
  <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">

    <p class="txt">Each of these might be scored using rubrics, checklists, or rating scales. As we saw, some of these approaches might be highly general and open ended, with the learner deciding many of the details concerning the what, where, when, and how of the performance. Others might be more specific and more structured, with the teacher spelling out exactly what is required.</p>
  </div> 

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Developmental Assessments</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">As the name implies, developmental assessments are performance-based assessments of an individual&#39;s progressive development. They look at changes and growth over time by documenting evidence of progressive accomplishments in the actual performances of the learner.</p>

	<p class="txt">Developmental assessments sometimes compare the student&#39;s performance to norms that reflect expected age- or grade-appropriate levels of performance. They can also be what are termed <em>self-referenced</em> assessments when the comparison made is to the individual rather than to a group or an objective norm.</p>

	<p class="txt">A variety of commercially prepared developmental assessment instruments are available, particularly for use with younger children (e.g., the Battelle Developmental Inventory, 2018). Some of them are designed specifically for nonverbal children and are therefore mainly performance based. They are used extensively to identify children with special needs and to suggest remedial strategies. For example, the Battelle Developmental Inventory is frequently used with children with <em>autism spectrum disorder</em> (Cunha, Berkovits, &#38; Albuquerque, 2018).</p>

	<p class="txt">Developmental assessments often use detailed checklists of behaviors as a guide for evaluating performance. They are also commonly used to monitor developmental progressions in physical, intellectual, and social development (see Figure 7.11). In some schools checklists of accomplishments have completely replaced more traditional report cards, especially in the early grades.</p>

	<p class="txt">Informal approaches to developmental assessments have long been common in schools, particularly in subject areas such as art, drama, music, and physical education. Unfortunately, these informal assessments are often made on the basis of intuition, first impressions, and predetermined expectations. As a result, their validity is often questionable.</p>

	<p class="txt">Here, as in all forms of performance-based assessment, it is essential that teachers have a clear notion of the instructional objectives being assessed and a detailed set of guidelines for making fair, valid, and generalizable assessments.</p>
	</div>
	</div>

<a id="p301"></a>
	<h2 class="h2">Demonstrations and Exhibitions</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">Demonstrations are a form of performance-based assessment that requires students to show they have attained a skill by actually performing it. Often, demonstrations are performances given at the examiner&#39;s request. The emphasis tends to be on the skill and on how well it is performed, rather than on the cognitive processes that might be involved.</p>

	<figure class="photo-right-small"> <img src="images/7.2.jpg" alt="Elementary-aged boy presenting an art project in front of his class." title="Elementary-aged boy presenting an art project in front of his class." id="img7.2"/>
        <figcaption>
          <p class="cr">Exactostock/SuperStock</p>
          <p class="caption">Assessments involving public exhibitions are common in art. Exhibitions are more public than are art portfolios.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Demonstrations are a common performance-based form of assessment for achievements, such as playing a musical instrument, extemporaneous public speaking, building a piece of furniture in a carpentry class, and making a souffl&#233; in a cooking class. Valid, generalizable assessments of the skills involved in these activities are unlikely to be based on responses to multiple-choice questions or on essays describing a step-by-step process for completing a specific task. &quot;Show me&quot; is often the only assessment request the instructor needs. Show-me types of demonstrations are highly common in the early grades, in which learners might be asked to &quot;show&quot; that they know how to read, count, write, hold their pencil, use a mouse, and so on.</p>

	<p class="txt">Exhibitions, like demonstrations, are a way of responding to the show-me request. But unlike demonstrations, exhibitions involve a public display of competence and achievement, rather than a private showing.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Exhibitions differ from most other types of performance-based assessment in that they emphasize the social nature of thinking and learning. Accordingly, they are most appropriate for skills and accomplishments for which public response is important.</p>

	<p class="txt">Not surprisingly, exhibition-based assessments are common in music, art, and drama. They can take the form of oral presentations, dramatizations, simulations, and various computer-based scenarios.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the advantages and limitations of portfolios?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
   <p class="intro">Portfolios are organized collections of the student&#39;s work. In effect, they are collections of samples of a student&#39;s demonstrations, exhibitions, and performances.</p>
   </div>
  <div class="section-body">

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">There are two general kinds of portfolios. One is the <strong>representative-sample portfolio</strong>, made up of sequential examples of the student&#39;s work and often showing a progression in the development of skills and concepts. The other is the <strong>best works portfolio</strong>, consisting of samples of the individual&#39;s best performances and most impressive achievements. For educational assessment, the representative-sample portfolio may present a better picture of learner progress. However, those who want to work as photographers or models should be sure that their portfolio contains only their very best photos.</p>
   
	<p class="txt">In the early grades, portfolios might consist of the child&#39;s first drawings, early efforts at printing, arithmetic work sheets, and perhaps samples of tests and quizzes that tap different processes and skills. In later grades, portfolios might include a more systematic and structured sampling of the student&#39;s work, representing a range of subjects and products and often including student self-appraisals. In a sense, portfolios are a visual record of progress and achievement.</p>
     
    <p class="txt">Portfolios have long been used in subjects such as art, photography, and journalism, in which a written or visual record of achievements is easily defined and gathered. With advances in audio and video technology and the possibility of computer-based portfolios, their usefulness as assessment tools has widened considerably to include fields such as film arts, drama, music, debating, and others.</p>

	<p class="key-point">As assessment tools, portfolios are designed not so much to allow students to show their parents their neat drawings and amazing stories but rather to provide teachers with another source of information that concerns the attainment of instructional objectives and indicates misconceptions and deficits that can be remedied.</p>

	<p class="txt">However, their usefulness for assessment and the validity and generalizability of the information they provide are highly dependent on how carefully&mdash;and intelligently&mdash;the teacher uses them.</p>

	<p class="txt">The following are some important guidelines and requirements in the use of portfolios for assessment.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Students and teachers need to know what is to be collected in the portfolio, by whom, when, and why.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Portfolio samples need to be representative (or the best samples available) rather than all-inclusive.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">A variety of other assessment procedures should be used in addition to portfolios.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Evaluation of portfolios should be based on explicit criteria.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Criteria for evaluation should be clearly understood by students (as well as teachers).</li>

	<h2 class="h2">Advantages of Portfolios</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Portfolios have a number of advantages and benefits in educational assessment. Among them are the following.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">They can significantly improve student achievement and motivation (Weldeana &#38; Sbhatu, 2017).</li>
          <li class="li_text">They can increase learners&#39; involvement in their own learning, leading to self-reflection and self-evaluation (Hamilton, 2018).</li>
		  <li class="li_text">They provide a measure of change&mdash;and presumably progress, although the opposite is sometimes the case&mdash;over time.</li>
          <li class="li_text">They give the teacher another view of how students approach problems, how they think and feel, and what their reactions are to their own work.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">They contribute to the development of self-regulated learners (Mak &#38; Wong, 2018).</li>
          <li class="li_text">They can serve as a guide for improving instructional strategies and reflection among teachers (Leslie &#38; Camargo-Borges, 2017).</li>
		  <li class="li_text">They are an effective way of showing parents their children&#39;s accomplishment, and they provide a basis for parent&#8211;teacher discussions.</li>
     </ul>

<a id="p304"></a>
	 <p class="txt">Some innovations in portfolio assessment show promise in terms of increasing student creativity as well as improving the reliability of these assessments. For example, computer-based portfolios (termed <strong>e-portfolios</strong>) have become increasingly common as a basis for both student self-evaluation and teacher evaluation of student performances (Torres, Garcia-Planas, &#38; Dominguez-Garcia, 2016). The advantages of e-portfolios include the very large number and variety of performance samples that can be included: visual or auditory; written or recorded; static or animated. In addition, they are easily accessible from virtually anywhere, totally portable, and virtually imperishable. They are not restricted to binders full of samples, nor are they limited to performances or exhibitions that need to have occurred in a specific place at a precise time. In many ways, they are more in the learner&#39;s control.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">To date, the bulk of the research on the use of e-portfolios has been done at the postsecondary level. For example, as Kelly-Riley, Elliot, and Rudniy (2016) report, both the University of Idaho and the New Jersey Institute of Technology successfully use e-portfolios as a fundamental assessment tool in determining student certification in their first-year writing programs. In these institutions, assessment of e-portfolios is done by teaching assistants, adjunct professors, and tenure-line faculty using evaluation models guided by detailed rubrics closely tied to course objectives.</p>
     
    <p class="txt">When Theodosiadou and Konstantinidis (2015) tried to introduce e-portfolios with 8-year-old students, they found noticeable benefits in terms of pupils&#39; increased self-esteem, parent involvement, and learning outcomes. However, as they point out, there are challenges in applying the use of e-portfolios with younger students.</p>

	<div class="single-column">

	<p class="txt">For one thing, building an e-portfolio can be a time-consuming and difficult task. And for both students and teachers who are not entirely comfortable with the technological skills and knowledge that might be required, developing an e-portfolio can be a daunting challenge.</p>

	<p class="txt">In addition, there are concerns about the possible lack of reliability of assessments based on e-portfolios&mdash;a concern that applies to other forms of performance assessment as well, especially when care has not been taken in developing rubrics. Concerns have also been raised about the ownership of portfolio content. Finally, in some schools there may be technical issues relating to Internet access, security, and availability of necessary hardware and software.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Limitations of Portfolios</h2>
	<div class="single-column">

	<p class="txt">We should note that despite the enthusiasm with which many educators embrace the concept of portfolio assessments, portfolios have a number of limitations and drawbacks. And, due to some of these limitations, portfolios are often used simply as a means of showing parents what the child and the school have been up to rather than as an assessment tool.</p>

	<p class="txt">Among the disadvantages of portfolio use for assessment are the following.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">There are often problems related to scoring. Even with a well-developed scoring guide, different examiners often come up with very different assessments. These are not always very useful (Oudkerk, Govaerts, Jaarsma, &#38; Driessen, 2018).</li>
          <li class="li_text">There are frequently problems of low validity, in which the uses and interpretations of portfolio assessments cannot easily be supported. Following a study involving 72 senior high school students, Chang, Tseng, Chou, and Chen (2011) report that web-based portfolio assessments (in this case, conducted by peers) provided results with very low validity. Low validity of portfolio assessments often results from lack of clear and easily applied evaluation criteria. As a result, these assessments do not always measure what they are intended to measure, and their meaning and usefulness may be impaired. Portfolio assessments are often holistic rather than highly specific. That is, they often provide global evaluations such as good, bad, better, or worse, rather than more precise indicators of achievement such A, B, C, or D. As Kimbell (2012) notes, we are much better at comparing than at making absolute judgments.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Portfolios can be difficult and time consuming to prepare.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Portfolios can be enormously time consuming to assess. For example, Del Principe (2010) reports that teachers seldom read all the multiple drafts of essays in portfolios in which successive drafts are intended to provide information for assessing progress and suggesting ways of helping learners.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Developing and maintaining portfolios, particularly e-portfolios, is sometimes difficult and can be costly.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Teachers are not always well enough informed or prepared to make intelligent use of portfolios for assessment.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Generalizing from portfolio samples may not always be warranted. This is especially true for best work portfolios, in which samples presented might be highly misleading&mdash;as might be the case for the would-be professional photographer whose stunningly good portfolio contains the only high-quality photographs he has taken among thousands of pathetically boring shots.</li>
     </ul>

	<p class="txt">Despite these limitations, there is little doubt that portfolios can provide an enormously useful approach to assessment. Their usefulness, however, may depend largely on the guidelines&mdash;the checklists and rubrics&mdash;that serve as a basis for evaluating them.</p>

	<p class="txt">Table 7.6 summaries the advantages and limitations of portfolios. <em>Applications: Using Portfolios</em> presents a case study of how one teacher went about developing a portfolio assignment.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Applications: Using Portfolios</h3>
        <p class="txt">Ms. Jefferson has just finished her first year of teaching and is now reflecting on how her high school biology class went. &quot;What&#39;s the use of being a teacher if you don&#39;t take the summer off?&quot; her girlfriends chide her. But Ms. Jefferson knows that in order to be a truly outstanding teacher, she must constantly assess her performance and her goals.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">As she looks back at her year&#39;s written reflections and at results from the traditional and performance-based assessments she has used, Ms. Jefferson confirms that students have met her most important content objectives. However, the introduction to the state standards goes well beyond mere content. For example, she wonders how successful she was in helping her students meet objective 7: Develop scientific dispositions and habits of mind (Commonwealth of Virginia Board of Education, 2003). &quot;How can I assess whether they have met this objective?&quot; she muses. Answering this question becomes one of her goals for next year.</p>

		<p class="txt">After much thought, and following consultations with her science colleagues and her former science education professor, she decides that a portfolio might be the best approach. She knows portfolios have many benefits and drawbacks and is hopeful that with planning, the drawbacks will be mitigated.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">First she decides she wants the portfolios to be summative instruments that allow students to evaluate their scientific dispositions and habits of mind. She sets her learning target: Identify the ways in which you (student) think like a scientist. Fortunately for Ms. Jefferson, objective 7 describes scientific habits of mind: They include curiosity, verification, logical and rational thinking, consideration of premises and consequences, respect for historical contributions, accuracy and precision, and patience and persistence (Commonwealth of Virginia Board of Education, 2003).</p>

		<p class="txt">&quot;Now, how do I get students to show me those things in a portfolio?&quot; wonders Ms. Jefferson. And after more thinking and planning, she finalizes her plans.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">She begins the new year by explaining to her students the nature of the course and its goals. Together, they analyze criteria for scientific dispositions and habits of mind, discussing what it means to a scientist and to be logical, rational, and curious. By the end of the first week, Ms. Jefferson is confident her students understand these concepts.</p>

		<p class="txt">Next she explains how portfolios will be developed. She stresses that these are not meant to be just a collection of assignments reflecting content knowledge but rather evidence of ways of thinking. Each student will have a work folder for all assignments and assessments. These will be graded as usual. Then, every 6 weeks, students will select from the folder one or two samples of work they believe reflect a scientific habit of mind. They will then write an explanation of how these samples are evidence of the habit of mind they have chosen. They may choose any of the habits of mind; but by the end of the school year, they must provide evidence of all of them.</p>

		<p class="txt">Ms. Jefferson then shares the rubrics she has developed to describe the characteristics of each habit of mind. Throughout the summer she has been asking herself, &quot;What does it <em>look like</em> and <em>sound like</em> when a scientist is curious? Seeks verification? Is precise and accurate?&quot; Finally, she passes out file folders in which students will store their work.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">&quot;Wow!&quot; she thinks. &quot;This took way more thought and planning than just developing end-of-unit tests. But portfolios just might not only serve as evidence that my students do think like scientists; they might actually help them develop scientific dispositions and habits of mind!&quot;</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">Today&#39;s schools stress learning how to learn; they are concerned with helping students become autonomous, reflective, independent, creative thinkers. Many think that current assessment practices are incompatible with these new emphases.</p>

</div>
  <div class="section-body">
  <div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">To the extent that our assessments demand the sort of linear thinking that is apparent in the selection or production of well-remembered, correct answers, the assessments foster a type of teaching and learning that does not result in minds that work well but rather in minds that reproduce well.</p>

	<p class="key-point">In many ways, performance-based assessment appears to be better attuned to our changing educational emphases.</p>

	<p class="txt">It provides more ways of viewing competence and excellence; it might expose social and intellectual skills that more traditional measures would overlook; and to the extent that it is more authentic, it might be more relevant to competency in the real world.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Yet performance-based assessment is more cumbersome, more time consuming, more difficult, and in most cases less exact.</p>

	<p class="txt">As a result, it is not often used for large-scale assessments. Also, performance-based assessments are not as easily quantifiable as more objective measures and are therefore not as useful for educational decisions that require comparisons. In short, they provide a less certain basis for answering questions such as &quot;Which 120 of these 500 college applicants should be admitted?&quot; or &quot;Which one of these 120 students should be given the Frank G. Sincere Fellowship?&quot; Table 7.7 outlines the primary advantages and limitations of performance-based assessment.</p>

      <h3 class="h3"> Performance-Based Assessment</h3>
      <p class="txt">Performance-based assessments look at the student&#39;s actual performances and productions. They are a relatively direct form of measurement and are more <em>authentic</em> to the extent that they reflect the constraints and demands of the real world. Among their benefits is the fact that they are often the best measures of objectives having to do with thinking, problem solving, communicating, and actually doing things in real life. They can be exceptionally useful as <em>formative</em> assessment and are sometimes indispensable for summative assessments in areas that demand actual performance. They tend to involve students and therefore contribute to motivation as well as to the development of self-assessment and self-regulation.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Requirements for Good Performance-Based Assessments</h3>
      <p class="txt">Although it is possible to devise performance-based assessments for many kinds of school learning, some are less suitable than others in terms of how well they assess progress toward learning objectives. Also important is the extent to which the results of a performance-based assessment can be generalized and how fair the assessment is. Often, practical considerations relating to the time and effort involved, and sometimes having to do with financial cost, suggest that other forms of assessment would be more appropriate. The fairness, generalizability, and appropriateness of performance-based measurements can be improved with the development of detailed scoring guides such as <em>rubrics</em>, <em>checklists</em>, and <em>rating scales</em>.</p>

    <a id="p309"></a>
      <h3 class="h3">Developing Performance-Based Assessments</h3>
      <p class="txt">Sequential steps in developing and implementing good performance-based assessment include (1) deciding on the main purpose of the assessment (formative or summative); (2) establishing and clarifying learning objectives, often in collaboration with colleagues, and communicating them to learners; (3) selecting and developing performance tasks that are closely aligned with learning targets; and (4) developing the rubrics, checklists, and rating scales that will be used to assess the performance tasks.</p>

	  <h3 class="h3">Rubrics, Checklists, and Rating Scales</h3>
      <p class="txt">A <em>rubric</em> is a formal guide used for scoring or evaluating an asssessment. Most rubrics specify the criteria that will be used in the assessment; many also include a numerical or verbal scale to differentiate among different levels of performance. <em>Holistic</em> rubrics are designed to yield a single assessment; <em>analytic</em> rubrics yield ratings for different criteria and are often represented as a grid. The first step in developing a rubric is to determine criteria (standards) for different levels of performance and how they should be refined and scaled. <em>Checklists</em> are scoring or evaluation guides that typically consist of unrelated (rather than sequential) items. <em>Rating scales</em> are scoring guides that allow the examiner to assign a relative value (numerical or verbal) to a performance. Many rubrics include rating scales in their assessment guides. Rubrics are useful for clarifying learning objectives and for increasing the reliability of assessments.</p>

	  <h3 class="h3">Varieties of Performance-Based Assessment</h3>
      <p class="txt">Approaches to performance-based assessments include <em>developmental assessments</em> that compare the learner&#39;s performances to expected performances and often take the form of checklists of developmental progressions; <em>demonstrations</em>, in which the learner is simply asked to <em>show</em> the teacher command of a particular skill; <em>exhibitions</em>, in which the product or performance in question is exposed to a wider audience, perhaps composed of classmates, parents, and others; and <em>portfolios</em>, which are collected samples of a student&#39;s work, either representing the student&#39;s best efforts or displaying sequential progress in a field. Portfolios are often physical collections but can also be digital (e-portfolios). The use of portfolios can lead to significant improvements in achievement, motivation, reflection, and self-direction. However, scoring them is often unreliable, and they are sometimes difficult, expensive, and time consuming to prepare.</p>
