<h2 class="h2">Ann Pearson</h2>

<p class="txt">Ann Pearson currently serves as the director of Curriculum and Catalog at San Jacinto College in Pasadena, Texas, where she often also teaches composition and literature. She earned her BA in English at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas, and her MA and PhD in English at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Ann is a lifelong learner who enjoys history, reading, traveling, and writing. Combining those interests, she has written historic fiction about the 1900 Galveston Storm and life on the Texas frontier, with many stories yet to tell. She lives just outside Houston with her husband, Dennie.</p>


<h2 class="h2">Sabrina Mathues</h2>

<p class="txt">Sabrina Mathues is a full-time faculty member and department chair for College Success at Brookdale Community College in Lincroft, New Jersey. She has previously served as acting dean of Academic Services and director of Off-Campus Programs at Ocean County College, coordinator of Academic Progress at Montclair State University, and undergraduate program coordinator and academic advisor for physics at Arizona State University. Her leadership roles have included terms as state liaison to NACADA (the Global Community for Academic Advising) for Arizona and New Jersey, assistant project manager for Strategic Planning at Ocean County College, and as a Guided Pathways consultant at community colleges throughout New Jersey. She holds a master of education degree in higher and postsecondary education from Arizona State University. Her areas of research interest focus on teaching methods in first-year seminar courses and career planning among undecided students. Sabrina resides near the Jersey Shore, where she enjoys collecting sea glass and acrylic painting. She would like to acknowledge her son, Noah, for being a model of boundless energy and for his immense patience.</p>

<p class="txt">Guy Lefran&ccedil;ois makes few claims to anything notable. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m an obscure French Canadian from a long line of obscure ancestors,&rdquo; he insists. &ldquo;Like me,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;most are better remembered not for the things they did but for those they never accomplished. Some of the things I haven&rsquo;t done are truly amazing!&rdquo; He currently holds an appointment at the University of Alberta, where he received his PhD and where he started teaching in 1966. Since then, he has written numerous books on psychology, many of which have been translated into other languages, including Chinese, Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, and German (he does not speak all these languages). He has been happily married to Marie for more years than he can easily count and loves to fish, watch birds, pick berries, read other people&rsquo;s words, and go on extended bicycle tours. He has three children (Laurier, Claire, and R&eacute;mi) and five grandchildren to whom this book is dedicated.</p>
