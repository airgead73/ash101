    <p class="txt">A ragamuffin, barefoot irreverence is what Neil Two-Feathers brought to his studies. He thought he was there more to question than to worship: He questioned everything. Some of his teachers had answers for him, or when they didn&#39;t, they pointed him to the best book, the right website, the correct authority. Others bristled at the implication that their offerings were somehow insufficient or, worse yet, inaccurate and misleading.</p>

    <p class="txt">Neil didn&#39;t always do well on teacher assessments. When faced with a series of multiple-choice items, he could never say all that he wanted to say. He always wanted to qualify, to add, &quot;Yes, that&#39;s correct, but. . .&quot; And when he responded to open-ended questions, his answers often led to other strikingly complex questions and seldom to textbook-sanctified answers.</p>

    <p class="txt">But in Mrs. Malacrida&#39;s class, he did exceptionally well.</p>
    <p class="txt">&quot;How can you give him such high marks?&quot; asked Mr. Lowen. &quot;In my classes, he&#39;s lucky if he gets 55&#37; or 60&#37; correct.&quot;</p>

  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">An important difference between Mr. Lowen&#39;s class and Mrs. Malacrida&#39;s has to do with the intended&#8212;and measured&#8212;outcomes of learning.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
	 <div class="single-column">
			
			<p class="txt">Whereas Mr. Lowen&#39;s preferred outcomes&#8212;his <em>learning objectives</em>&#8212;emphasized knowledge of measurable items of information, Mrs. Malacrida was far more concerned with developing learning skills and strategies in her learners. The intended and desired outcomes of their teaching were vastly different. Their courses aimed at different learning (or <em>instructional</em>) objectives.</p>

			<p class="txt">Learners such as Neil Two-Feathers have learning styles that fit well with teaching approaches designed to develop independent thinkers and autonomous learners. They fit less well when instructional objectives are expressed more specifically in terms of acquiring information and mastering well-defined techniques for manipulating it. It&#39;s hard to overestimate the importance of intended and desired learning outcomes.</p>

		<h2 class="h2">Learning Objectives Are the Start of Backward Design</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">

        <p class="txt">In the <em>backward design</em> approach discussed in Chapter 1, intended and desired learning outcomes are the objectives that underlie curriculum development, determine approaches to assessment, guide instruction, and ultimately determine what students learn. To review briefly, the three steps of the backward design process are</p>
	
		<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">identify the objectives of the curriculum or of the lesson or unit,</li>
          <li class="li_text">decide on appropriate assessments for determining whether these objectives have been met, and</li>
          <li class="li_text">plan instructional activities designed to foster attainment of objectives.</li>
        </ol>
		</div>
		</div>
	<h2 class="h2">Learning Objectives Are Different From Goals</h2>
	  <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Educational goals or standards are general statements of desired educational outcomes. As Table 1.5 in Chapter 1 explains, the terms <em>goals</em> and <em>standards</em> are used interchangeably in this text, as are <em>learning</em> objectives and <em>instructional</em> objectives. Table 1.5 lists some of the very general goals of the principle piece of legislation governing K&#8211;12 education in the United States, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)&#8212;goals such as the requirement that &quot;all students will be taught to high academic standards.&quot;</p>

          <p class="caption">In real-life endeavors, we set targets and choose ways of reaching them. Sometimes we know very clearly when we have achieved them&#8212;as is the case for this mountaineer. In education, our targets aren&#39;t always so clear; nor are the assessments we use to determine how far we have yet to climb and how best to continue.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

	  <div class="single-column">		
		
		<h3 class="h3">What Are Goals?</h3>
        <p class="key-point">Goals (or standards) can be thought of as the broad, idealistic notions that describe the qualities or outcomes we strive toward. Goals are abstract ideas rather than specific targets. They are a very general guide to instruction and assessment in the classroom.</p>
	
        <p class="txt">While goals such as &quot;all students with limited English proficiency will become proficient in English&quot; suggest some of the things we need to teach and assess, they are not very useful in actually devising instructional strategies or assessments. For example, an assessment procedure designed to determine whether all students are proficient in English needs to be based on a very clear description of what it means to be English proficient. The test maker needs to know which specific behaviors define proficiency.</p>

        <a id="p140"></a>
		<p class="txt">Statements of these behaviors illustrate the meaning of the phrase <em>learning objectives</em>. Clear statements of objectives can serve as <strong>criteria</strong> against which student performance can be judged to assess the extent to which learning objectives are being met. A criterion may be defined as a standard that serves as a basis for making an evaluation.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">What Are Instructional Objectives?</h3>
		<p class="txt">Instructional objectives (also referred to as <em>learning objectives</em> or <em>learning targets</em>) usually take the form of statements of actual student behaviors or actions related to achieving desired outcomes. In contrast with goals, which are abstract and general, instructional objectives are specific. Statements of instructional objectives are generally broken down into progressions, discrete steps, or identifiable actions. They might also include deadlines and limitations. For example, an instructional objective relating to a lesson on serving in volleyball might specify that students will be able to serve the ball over the net and within bounds at least two out of every five attempts.</p>

		<p class="txt">One important difference between goals and objectives has to do with their measurability. Goals (or standards) are abstract ideals: for example, &quot;Be a good citizen.&quot; As a result, they do not suggest very specific actions that can be measured. However, even a broad goal such as &quot;Be a good citizen&quot; can be redefined in terms of measurable learning objectives. For example, these objectives might take the form of specific actions relating to altruism, involvement in social or athletic school groups, or conservation-based endeavors.</p>

		<p class="key-point">Although they are based on broad standards, the most useful instructional (learning) objectives are usually expressed as specific outcomes or progressions that can be measured directly.</p>
			
		<p class="txt">As a result, clearly stated instructional objectives identify specific actions or behaviors that can be marked off on a checklist or otherwise assessed for their completeness (see Figure 4.1). Highly specific instructional objectives, couched in terms of precise learner behaviors, are especially useful in designing assessment procedures. In effect, as noted in Chapter 1, they tell the teacher three fundamentally important things:</p>

		<ol class="nl">
		<li class="li_text">what needs to be taught</li>
		<li class="li_text">what needs to be assessed</li>
		<li class="li_text">how it will be assessed</li>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">When a subject lends itself to unambiguous learning objectives, the task of preparing useful assessments and selecting instructional procedures can be very simple.</p>
	</div>
   <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">

    <p class="txt">Consider, for example, learning objectives such as the following.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">The learner will be able to add correctly any two numbers from 0 to 9.</li>
          <li class="li_text">The learner will be able to key a randomly selected passage from any of the test exercises in <em>Keyboarding for Fun and Profit</em> at a rate of 48 words per minute over a 5-minute period, with no more than two errors.</li>
     </ul>

    <p class="txt">Devising tests to measure how well these objectives are being met is a relatively simple undertaking. In the first case, teachers can easily generate a series of written or oral problems of the kind 2 + 7 = __, or 4 + 6 = __. And in the second instance, teachers need only select a passage from <em>Keyboarding for Fun and Profit</em> at random, allow each student precisely 5 minutes of keyboarding time, and read input and error rates on the computer screen.</p>

    <a id="p142"></a>
    <p class="txt">In contrast, statements of broad educational goals do not lend themselves easily to very specific instructional procedures or assessments. For example, consider the following goals.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">The student will become a better football player.</li>
          <li class="li_text">The learner will become proficient in Swahili.</li>
     </ul>

	 <p class="txt">Neither of these perfectly legitimate and commendable goals suggests how to assess their attainment or how to organize instruction. However, each does imply a number of criteria that might be taken as a sign that the target has been reached.</p>
     </div>
	 
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Using Criteria to Define Success</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Although general statements of goals have limited immediate practical value for instruction and assessment, the criteria that define success in reaching a goal can often be expressed in terms of more specific, and more useful, instructional objectives. For example, becoming a better soccer player might require certain explicit, teachable, and assessable changes in skills such as those involved in running, making a pass, heading the ball, and learning defensive and offensive strategies. These are some of the criteria a coach might use to judge skill level and progress.</p>

    <p class="key-point">One way of assessing criteria such as these is to use a checklist. Table 4.1 shows a sample checklist that a coach might use to evaluate an individual player.</p>

        <p class="txt"><strong><u>S</u>pecific.</strong> The most useful instructional objectives are those that are clear and that tell both the learner and the teacher exactly what is expected.</p>

		<p class="txt"><strong><u>M</u>easurable.</strong> Learning objectives should take the form of actions or products that can be assessed. Measurable objectives are those for which the central question &quot;How will I know the objective has been reached?&quot; can be answered.</p>
		
        <p class="txt"><strong><u>A</u>ttainable.</strong> The aim is to develop instructional objectives that are within reach of the learner. At the same time, objectives should be challenging. Instructional objectives that present no challenge lead to little learning.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">In an effort to simplify assessment tasks for teachers, Bloom and his colleagues analyzed educational objectives, dividing them into various classes (labeled <em>domains</em>; Bloom, Engelhart, Furst, Hill, &#38; Krathwohl, 1956).</p>
	
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">

    <p class="txt">The resulting classification is known as <strong>Bloom&#39;s taxonomy</strong>. It is intended to provide a relatively complete listing of the sorts of behaviors, performances, and skills around which teachers should build their instructional objectives. The list serves to guide teachers&#39; instructional strategies and their assessments.</p>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Three Major Domains</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Bloom&#39;s guide for developing instructional objectives provides an exhaustive list of different kinds of objectives relating to cognition and affect (having to do with emotion)&#8212;referred to as the <strong>cognitive domain</strong> and the <strong>affective domain</strong>. Later, a third domain, the <strong>psychomotor domain</strong>, was added (Krathwohl, Bloom, &#38; Masia, 1964).</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Understanding Taxonomies</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Bloom and his associates labeled their lists of kinds of objectives <em>taxonomies</em>. <em>Taxonomy</em> is a termed used primarily in branches of sciences such as biology and botany, where it refers to the identification and classification of things like organisms, plant species, or fossils. Bloom&#39;s <strong>taxonomy of educational objectives</strong> is an attempt to classify and organize an exhaustive list of all the important classes of objectives.</p>
   
	<p class="key-point">Although it is described as a taxonomy of educational objectives, the taxonomy is not made up of specific instructional objectives. Rather, it describes different kinds of objectives within the three major domains: cognitive, affective, and later, psychomotor.</p>

    <p class="txt">More recently, as we will see later, other researchers have suggested additional changes that take into account current interest and findings in areas such as cognition and information processing (for example, Anderson &#38; Krathwohl, 2001; Darwazeh, 2017).</p>

    <h2 class="h2">The Usefulness of Bloom&#39;s</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Lists such as Bloom&#39;s taxonomy are useful as guides for determining learning objectives for a lesson or course and, perhaps even more important, for planning instruction and assessment. Bloom&#39;s taxonomy provides a list of different kinds of objectives for two of the three domains: the cognitive and the affective. Although it includes no goals for the psychomotor domain, other researchers later provided some.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How does Bloom&#39;s taxonomy differentiate among cognitive skills?</span></h2>   
	</div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
  <p class="intro">The taxonomy of objectives for the cognitive domain describes six classes of objectives. These six categories are assumed to be hierarchical in the sense that lower level skills develop before higher level skills.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
  
	
	<h2 class="h2">Knowledge/Remembering</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">The lowest level cognitive domain of objectives relates to <strong>knowledge</strong>. It requires only that learners be able to recall information such as, for example, the textbook definition of the expression <em>educational standard</em>. In the revised taxonomy, this category is labeled <em>remembering</em> (Anderson &#38; Krathwohl, 2001). An instructional objective related to the knowledge category might be worded as follows: &quot;The student will recite the alphabet without error in less than 1 minute.&quot; Darwazeh&#39;s (2017) revision of the Bloom taxonomy suggests that it might be useful to differentiate among specific facts and generalities.</p>
	</div>
	
  <a id="p146"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Comprehension/Understanding</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt"><strong>Comprehension</strong> (labeled <em>understanding</em> in the revision), the next highest level, requires demonstrating an understanding of something&#8212;of its meaningfulness. Within this category, learners might be asked to summarize or explain something, such as the meaning of the word <em>area</em>, for example.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Application/Applying</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt"><strong>Application</strong> typically involves using information. This might require applying previously learned information in practical situations or using previously learned rules to solve a new problem. As part of a unit on measuring area, an application task might invite students to determine the square footage of a baseball diamond or of their classroom. Note that whereas comprehension indicates simple understanding of something, such as area, application entails the ability to apply learning in new situations, such as in calculating the area of a given surface.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Analysis/Analyzing</h2>
	<div class="single-column"> 
	<p class="txt"><strong>Analysis</strong> is the breaking down of something into its components to understand it better. Sixth graders might be asked to compare two poems, paying particular attention to the use of language to create emotional reactions. High school students might be invited to identify structural elements in a piece of literature and to compare them with elements in another work.</p>
    </div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Synthesis/Evaluating</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">In the original taxonomy, <strong>synthesis</strong> (understanding by looking at the larger organization) was next, followed by evaluation (arriving at a value judgment). But in Anderson and Krathwohl&#39;s revision, synthesis is placed at the highest level. In Darwazeh&#39;s revision, which contains more categories, the order of the last seven items in the cognitive domain is as follows: analysis, organizing, synthesis, application, evaluation, creation, and metacognition.</p>

	<p class="txt">To evaluate is to determine the worth, goodness, or value of something. For example, when students are asked to debate the merits of school uniform requirements for public schools, they are being asked for evaluative judgments. Similarly, when a student is asked to appraise an argument, evaluation is being tapped.</p>
    </div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Evaluation/Creating</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">To synthesize is to put together, to combine elements to form a new pattern or structure. The Anderson and Krathwohl (2001) revision of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy uses the verb <em>create</em> for this level, because they believed synthesis to be a creative activity. Requiring learners to generate new uses for an old sock might tap creative processes. Asking 10th graders to write an original sonnet would be a creative (synthesis-based) task&#8212;as would asking them to use a yard of masking tape and a piece of construction paper to build a bridge strong enough to hold a dictionary..</p>

	<h2 class="h2">A Comparison</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Bloom&#39;s original taxonomy and the Anderson and Krathwohl revision, as well as an example of how each objective in the cognitive domain might suggest a question or task that could be used to assess it, are shown in Figure 4.2.

    <p class="txt">Darwazeh (2017) points out that synthesizing is not really a creative activity&#8212;it involves activities such as figuring out relationships among ideas, making connections, inferring, and concluding rather than creating. Accordingly, his hierarchy lists 10 processes rather than the original six, and he orders them somewhat differently, as shown in Figure 4.3.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">As Figure 4.3 illustrates, verbs suggest very specific instructional and assessment procedures. For example, the verb <em>calculate</em> (related to <em>analysis</em>) suggests that instruction should be directed toward ensuring that the learner knows <em>how</em> to carry out relevant calculations. Related assessments will ask the learner to perform the specified calculation.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Bloom&#39;s Four Types of Knowledge</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">In Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, knowledge (or <em>remembering</em>), as shown in Figure 4.4, is further subdivided into factual knowledge, conceptual knowledge, procedural knowledge, and metacognitive knowledge.</p>

	<p class="txt"><strong>Factual knowledge</strong> refers to knowledge of specifics or of details. A factual knowledge instructional objective might be worded something like this: &quot;The learner will memorize the names of the authors of each of the poems in the assigned text&quot; or &quot;The student will identify common measures of distance.&quot; Corresponding assessment items might be &quot;Who wrote &#39;Ode to a Fat Hen&#39;?&quot; or &quot;How many feet are there in a mile?&quot;</p>

	<p class="txt"><strong>Conceptual knowledge</strong> is knowledge that has to do with ideas, sometimes expressed as generalizations, theories, or models. A conceptual knowledge instructional objective might be &quot;Learners will be able to interpret the meanings of the metaphors used in the poem &#39;All Is Okay in the Middle.&#39;&quot; Related assessment items might be &quot;Interpret the meaning of the phrase &#39;It was a murderous feather he clutched, a feather I insist. . .&#39;&quot; or, &quot;Write a short poem that introduces a new metaphor in each stanza.&quot;</p>

	<p class="txt"><strong>Procedural knowledge</strong> deals with methods, skills, techniques, or approaches that are used for doing things and includes criteria concerning when and how different procedures should be used. Learning targets relating to procedural knowledge typically ask learners to demonstrate procedures or to perform. An example of a <em>procedural knowledge</em> instructional objective is &quot;The learner will compute the surface area of different shapes.&quot; Sample assessment items could include &quot;What is the area in square feet of a rectangular 12-yard by 156-inch room?&quot; or &quot;What is twice the area of a right-angled triangle where the two sides that form the right angle are 12 and 15 centimeters long respectively?&quot;</p>

	<p class="txt"><strong>Metacognitive knowledge</strong>, as we saw in Chapter 3, refers to the knowledge learners have of their own cognitive processes. Metacognitive knowledge includes personal knowledge about the strategies the learner uses to memorize, learn, understand, analyze, synthesize, and apply. In short, it includes all that we know about our own processes of knowing. Examples of instructional objectives having to do with metacognitive knowledge might take the form &quot;Learners will assess how effectively they are learning&quot; or &quot;Learners will be able to describe how they memorized the poem &#39;I Am Really Great.&#39;&quot; Assessment tasks might ask learners to predict how quickly they can memorize a passage. Or they might be asked to described <em>how</em> they memorize (that is, the <em>memory strategies</em> they use).</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Comparing With Darwazeh&#39;s Three Objectives of Knowledge</h3>
	<p class="txt">The main differences between Darwazeh&#39;s (2017) revision of the Bloom taxonomy and the original revision relates directly to the knowledge category. Whereas the original describes a single knowledge objective (comprising four different types of knowledge), Darwazeh lists three distinct objectives, each of which was originally subsumed in Bloom&#39;s <em>knowledge</em> category: facts remembrance, generalities remembrance, and metacognition.</p>

  <a id="p150"></a>
	<p class="txt">In Darwazeh&#39;s view, metacognition is the highest level of human cognitive activity. Accordingly, it is listed at the very apex of objectives in the cognitive domain. Metacognition consists of three major processes, says Darwazeh (2017):</p>

	<p class="ext">Awareness of the mental process that the learner uses before learning; (2) Monitoring of the mental process that the learner uses during learning; and (3) Regulating the cognitive process that the learner uses after learning as she or he faces difficulties in learning. (p. 18)</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Using Taxonomy Grids</h3>
	<p class="txt">As shown in Figure 4.4, the revised Bloom&#39;s taxonomy can be shown as a grid rather than a hierarchy. The vertical part of the grid contains the four dimensions of the knowledge objective just described (factual, conceptual, procedural, and metacognitive knowledge). The horizontal part lists sequentially the lowest level of cognitive activity (remembering) followed by the five cognitive domains that represent what are referred to as <em>higher</em> cognitive processes (understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating).</p>

	<div class="single-column">
     <p class="txt">According to Anderson and Krathwohl (2001), an advantage of presenting the taxonomy as a grid rather than as a linear list or a pyramid is that it provides educators with a 24-cell matrix into which they can place various instructional objectives and assessment items. In the grid cognitive objectives are numbered, whereas the four dimensions of knowledge are given letters. This system allows educators to identify each of the 24 cells in terms of a number and letter combination. Thus, cell 2-A refers to instructional objectives and assessment procedures that relate to understanding factual ideas; cell 5-C has to do with evaluating procedures or skills.</p>
		
    <a id="p151"></a>
     <p class="txt">In practice a teacher might use this grid to develop instructional objectives and related assessment for each cell. Doing so would ensure that higher as well as lower level cognitive skills are being fostered and assessed. Suppose, for example, that a teacher of a third-grade arithmetic class wanted to develop instructional objectives and related assessments for cell 3-A, which has to do with applying factual knowledge. Basically, cell 3-A describes activities involved in carrying out or using a procedure in a given situation. In third grade, relevant procedures might include methods for adding two-digit numbers, ways of counting (by twos and threes, or by odd and even numbers, for example), or ways of solving simple verbal problems. Thus, two instructional objectives corresponding to cell 3-A might be worded like this: &quot;Learners will be able to recognize a number as being odd or even&quot; and &quot;Learners will be able to add one- and two-digit numbers.&quot; A corresponding assessment item might take the form of a question such as &quot;Is 73 + 5 odd or even?&quot; (For more examples relating to a third-grade mathematics curriculum, see <em>In the Classroom: Using Bloom&#39;s Taxonomy for Assessment and Instruction</em>.)</p>
		
     <p class="key-point">It is important to realize that instructional objectives describe what is to be taught and learned as well as what is to be assessed. Alignment between broad educational goals, specific objectives, instructional approaches, and assessment is basic to good teaching.</p>

	 <p class="txt">Simple questions and procedures such as those used to illustrate assessment of objectives corresponding to cell 3-A can&#8212;and should&#8212;be used frequently during instruction to provide feedback for learners and teachers. This type of formative assessment should be an integral part of instruction (see Chapter 5).</p>

          <p class="caption">Students tend to study what they know will be tested: That&#39;s part of being successfully intelligent. No matter how much a teacher insists that her main goal is to promote creativity and develop critical-thinking skills, as long as her quizzes ask her students to <em>reproduce</em> rather than <em>produce</em>, this student will continue to underline and memorize everything that looks like a possible multiple-choice item.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	
    <p class="txt">Earlier, we noted the importance of what teachers test in determining what and how students learn. As Bezuidenhout and Alt (2011) put it, &quot;Students tend to learn in the way they know, or think, they will be assessed&quot; (p. 1062).</p>

    <p class="txt">All too often, schools evaluate students on the basis of how many textbook- and teacher-presented facts they remember rather than on the basis of how much they understand, how cleverly they generalize and extrapolate, or how elegantly they formulate hypotheses and generate new concepts. Research on Bloom&#39;s taxonomy corroborates this observation. For example, when Thompson (2011) analyzed items used in statewide Algebra 1 end-of-course tests, he found that very few items assessed higher order thinking as described in Bloom&#39;s taxonomy.</p>

	  <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Additional corroboration of this finding comes from a study that looked at more than 10,000 examination and quiz items submitted by 50 biology instructors (Momsen, Long, Wyse, &#38; Ebert-May, 2010). When researchers classified these items based on Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, they found that the items required lower levels of thinking than the instructors had expressed when describing their goals.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">In another study, an analysis of more than 8,800 questions used primarily in high school tests showed that nearly 80&#37; dealt only with knowledge of facts and specifics&#8212;the lowest level in Bloom&#39;s taxonomy (Fleming &#38; Chambers, 1983). And although Thompson (2011) reported a recent increase in items that tap higher level processes, test makers often mistakenly assume that items that are placed in a real-world context invariably tap higher level processes such as applying or analyzing. Unfortunately, that is far from always the case.</p>

    <h2 class="h2">Understanding Versus Applying</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">As we saw, the categories of objectives described by Bloom and associates (1956) and revised by Anderson and Krathwohl (2001) and Darwazeh (2017) fall into two broad classes: those that involve remembering and those that require thinking.</p>

	<p class="txt">Most teachers want to develop higher level thinking skills in their students. They try to teach for understanding (comprehension, application, evaluation, analysis, synthesis, and so on). Yet few know clearly the precise skills involved in these high-level cognitive activities. Of these skills, the two that are most frequently confused are understanding (comprehension) and applying.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Understanding implies the ability to capture the substance of what is being communicated without necessarily relating it to other material.</p>

	<p class="txt">Understanding can be tested through items that require the students to translate (change from one form of communication to another; express in their own words), interpret (explain or summarize), or extrapolate (predict consequences or arrive at conclusions).</p>

	<p class="key-point">Applying, on the other hand, requires that learners be able to use what they understand&#8212;that they abstract from one situation to another.</p>

	<p class="txt">Application cannot be tested simply by asking that students interpret or translate; they must also be required to abstract the material to see its implications.</p>

	<p class="txt">One final point needs to be made: Your instructional objectives (what you want your students to learn and be able to do) are communicated directly and effectively through your assessments.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Even if you emphasize repeatedly that you want to teach for high-level skills, you will probably not be successful unless you construct achievement tests that reflect these objectives.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">In the final analysis, your students will study and learn what you test. Ideally, what you test will also be what you have intended to teach.</p>

  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">Bloom&#39;s taxonomy and its subsequent revisions relate to cognitive objectives: These objectives are concerned with the mental processes involved in knowing. They emphasize processes such as remembering and all the activities we consider to be at play in more advanced forms of thinking (the so-called higher mental processes).</p>

          <p class="caption">Learning targets are not limited to cognitive skills. Nor are the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains entirely distinct. There is much thought (cognition) that goes into how to play this game, not to mention some highly developed psychomotor skills. And the affect (emotion) displayed is clearly far from neutral.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

	  <div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">However, the objectives of our educational systems are not concerned only with cognitive matters.</p>

    <p class="txt">Many instructional objectives are also directed toward the affective, or emotional, development of learners (covered later in this chapter). And some are concerned with psychomotor development, the development of motor skills and coordination.</p>
	</div>
	
  <a id="p154"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Definition</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Psychomotor skills involve physical movement. High levels of <strong>psychomotor skills</strong> are apparent in well-coordinated movements such as those displayed in professional sports. Psychomotor skills are often measured in terms of factors such as speed, coordination, accuracy, distance, and body position and movement.</p>
        
	<p class="txt">While objectives related to cognitive activity describe what takes place in the mind, objectives in the psychomotor domain are strikingly different. Because they depend on physical rather than cognitive activity, their assessment typically requires the learner to do something&#8212;to perform. For example:</p>
	
	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Imitation: Students will trace the letters of the alphabet over the dotted outline of the letter.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Manipulation: After learning about rhythm, students will beat the rhythm of a new piece of music.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Precision: After the unit on the mechanisms of throwing a football, students will throw the football through the hanging tire.</li>
        </ul>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">The Development of Psychomotor Skills</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	
	<p class="txt">As we noted earlier, Bloom&#39;s original taxonomy did not provide objectives in the psychomotor domain. Subsequently, a number of researchers, including Simpson (1972), Dave (1970), and Harrow (1972), did. Like Bloom, these researchers assumed that skills in the psychomotor domain are hierarchical in the sense that lower level skills are typically apparent before higher level skills.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Yet as we saw with respect to cognitive skills, the behaviors that represent them are not always very distinct. Many of the skills might be present simultaneously, overlap, or appear in reverse order.</p>

	<p class="txt">While different lists of objectives representing motor skills have been presented by different researchers, most of them have much in common. This discussion combines and simplifies several of these approaches.</p>

  <a id="p155"></a>
	<h3 class="h3">Observation/Perception</h3>
	<p class="txt">At the lowest level is <em>observation</em> or <em>perception</em>. This describes an early stage in the learning of motor skills, during which the learner simply observes and gradually develops the ability to use sensory cues to guide motor activity.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Imitation/Guided Responding</h3>
	<p class="txt">Next is a skill labeled <em>imitation</em> or <em>guided responding</em>. This refers to motor actions that are guided either by instructions or by observing a model. Models need not be actual people doing something but can be any of a variety of <strong>symbolic models</strong>&#8212;things like written or verbal instructions, film or computerized models, and so on. <strong>Observational learning</strong> (another term for <em>imitation</em>) supplies a powerful explanation for much human learning (Bandura &#38; Walters, 1963).</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Manipulation/Fundamental Movements</h3>
    <p class="txt"><em>Manipulation</em> (Dave, 1970) or <em>fundamental movements</em> (Harrow, 1972) is a stage during which the learner begins to display the motor skill in question. The term <em>manipulation</em> is used to indicate that performance is still not highly integrated and continues to require guidance despite the learner&#39;s increasing confidence.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Precision/Complex Overt Response</h3>
	<p class="txt">In the next stage, the learner manifests what Dave (1970) terms <em>precision</em> and Simpson (1972) calls <em>complex overt response</em>. Proficiency in the skill has grown to the point that the learner can execute complex actions more accurately and precisely. The execution of the motor action is now marked by few errors.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Adaptation/Articulation</h3>
	<p class="txt">During the level labeled <em>adaptation</em> (Dave [1970] calls it <em>articulation</em>), learners have become far more adept at the motor skill. They now understand the requirements of the motor activity to such an extent that they can combine and integrate related aspects of the behavior. At this level, the gifted and skilled athlete invents new moves that confound and dazzle spectators and competitors.</p>

  <a id="p156"></a>
	<h3 class="h3">Origination/Naturalization</h3>
    <p class="txt">At the highest level, <em>origination</em> (the term used by Simpson [1972]), performance of the skill is internalized. Students are now more performers than learners. They are sufficiently advanced that they can now be teachers, composers, designers, inventors, and so on. Dave (1970) calls this level <em>naturalization</em> to indicate that the performance has become so high level and <em>natural</em> that it can be executed with little need for conscious thought. At this stage, the performance is so good that it looks easy.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Psychomotor Skills in Education</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Researchers and educators have paid much more attention to the cognitive than to the psychomotor domain. Yet the development of motor skills is a fundamental feature of most schools.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Psychomotor skills are not limited to the sorts of expertise necessary for proficiency in endeavors such as sports, athletics, gymnastics, or dance.</p>

  <a id="p157"></a>
    <p class="txt">Nor are they limited to simple motor skills such as those involved in eating, walking, drinking, and talking. These are clearly important, but a variety of other motor skills are also closely related to success in more cognitive undertakings. These include skills such as typing, manipulating objects in science classes, building models, painting, drawing, playing musical instruments, excavating artifacts, gathering plant samples, speaking a language fluently, and designing a map.</p>

	<p class="txt">Figure 4.5 illustrates how the different dimensions of the psychomotor domain can be described using a number of related verbs. Like those we looked at in connection with the cognitive domain (Figure 4.2), these can be used to generate instructional activities. They can also serve as guides for assessment procedures.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are the five affective categories in Bloom&#39;s taxonomy?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">Affective domain objectives are those that have to do with underlying emotions, feelings, and values rather than with cognitive processes.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
    <div class="single-column">
      

      <p class="txt">Affect is basically a synonym for <em>emotion</em>. Affect has to do with how we handle emotional issues&#8212;how we respond emotionally. Emotional intelligence is evident in how well we recognize emotions in ourselves and others and how appropriately we express those emotions.</p>
	  </div>
	
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Affect in Education</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	  <p class="txt">Emotions are fundamentally involved in values, motivation, and attitudes. To value something&#8212;or not to do so&#8212;is to react emotionally (in terms of affect). To be motivated is to have an interest, to want. And the wanting, the interest, might be related to any of thousands of actions or objectives: to want to do, to have, to be, to see, to accomplish, to learn, to master, and so on.</p>

	  <p class="txt">Bloom&#39;s original taxonomy lists five major categories in the affective domain. Like the categories in the cognitive and psychomotor domain, these suggest key verbs that in turn can serve as a useful basis for designing approaches to instruction and assessment. And like the cognitive and psychomotor lists, the five affective categories are assumed to be hierarchical and are listed in that order.</p>

      <p class="key-point">Taken hierarchically, the sequential categories describe how values, beliefs, and attitudes might gradually change as a result of experience. Schools and teachers might be called on to change some values and to reinforce others. We want our learners to value education. We want them to be interested, persistent, and highly motivated. Also, we want them to develop social values such as those involved in caring for others and for our planet.</p>

	  <p class="txt">Because these are the things we value for ourselves and for our children, as educators, we need to develop curricula that reflect these values and use assessments and instructional approaches that foster them&#8212;approaches that encourage enjoyment of learning, support collaboration, encourage self-direction, and promote the fullest development of learner potential.</p>
	  </div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Receiving</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The most basic of Bloom&#39;s affective categories is <em>receiving</em>&#8212;or, as Krathwohl and colleagues (1964) call it, <em>receiving phenomena</em>. This category describes the process of paying attention to stimuli, of being open to the views and beliefs of others. It implies a willingness to at least be exposed to other values. For example, Anjali, who dislikes chemistry, demonstrates receiving when she agrees to attend an introductory chemistry lecture with her friend Tiana, the chemistry whiz.</p>
	</div>
	
  <a id="p159"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Responding</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt"><em>Responding</em> (to phenomena) involves active participation rather than the passive exposure typical of receiving. Now individuals might ask questions as they attend to a different point of view, and they might actively respond in ways that reflect their own attitudes and values. If Anjali were to ask Tiana questions as she tries to understand the importance and potential contributions of chemistry, she would be responding.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Valuing</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The third category, <em>valuing</em>, entails attaching a value to something. The value might be one of simple acceptance, rejection, or strong agreement and attraction. Valuing implies having an internalized set of values. These values lead individuals to rank and judge certain objects, activities, or beliefs positively or negatively. Values are typically apparent in the individual&#39;s behavior. Anjali&#39;s increasing willingness to discuss chemistry, watch science programs, and even consider taking a chemistry class indicates that she has begun to value the discipline positively.</p>
	</div>
  
  <div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Organizing</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt"><em>Organizing</em>, the next level, reflects the fact that as the individual is exposed to different values, internal conflicts may arise. Organizing values implies resolving conflicts and determining which values are important and which are more trivial. Anjali might now begin to <em>revalue</em> other disciplines if valuing them too highly presents a significant conflict. For example, if she has begun to contemplate abandoning her dream of being an artist for a career as a chemist, she will need to organize her values.</p>
	</div>
  </div>
  
	<h2 class="h2">Internalizing</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt"><em>Internalizing values</em> is the end result of organization. The individual now has an internalized, organized, and prioritized system of values. And although these likely will reflect the values of the significant people and institutions in the person&#39;s life, it is nevertheless a unique, consistent, and personal set of principles. In the end, Anjali internalizes her personal ideals&#8212;and perhaps they drive her to the science faculty.</p>

	<p class="txt">Figure 4.6 lists these five affective domain categories and presents verbs associated with each. As is the case for terms associated with the cognitive and psychomotor domain, these are especially useful for suggesting ways of instilling and reinforcing values in learners&#8212;and perhaps for arriving at ways of evaluating the development of student values.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
   <p class="intro">The easy separation of educational objectives into the three domains&#8212;cognitive, psychomotor, and affective&#8212;is misleading. Things are seldom as simple in the real world as we make them out to be in our theories. In fact, activities in these three domains are closely interrelated.</p>
   
   </div>
  <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">
     

      <p class="txt">Motor activity involves mental activities&#8212;hence the label <em>psychomotor</em> rather than simply <em>motor</em>. An athlete is not like a mechanical robot programmed to mindlessly perform elegant dances and astonishing acrobatics. The skilled athlete&#39;s mind is exceptionally adept at cognitive activities such as visualizing motor performances, imagining sequences of motor acts, making decisions about actions, monitoring performance, anticipating the movements of teammates and opponents, and foreseeing the consequences of specific actions.</p>

      <p class="txt">Cognitive activity, too, is not completely isolated from activity in other domains. As Anderson and Krathwohl (2001) note, &quot;Nearly every cognitive objective has an affective component&quot; (p. 258). For example, when a teacher teaches a subject, the objective is not simply to have learners master its fundamental concepts, ideas, rules, or formulas. In most cases one of the important goals is to arouse the learner&#39;s interest, to encourage the learner to value the subject and perhaps to become motivated to learn even more. These are all aspects of affective learning.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">How can taxonomies of kinds of objectives be used for designing instruction?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
   <p class="intro">Taxonomies of educational objectives have a number of important uses in the classroom. For example, they suggest a wide variety of instructional activities, each of which can be aimed at developing a particular instructional objective.</p>
   </div>
  <div class="section-body">

	<figure class="photo-right"> <img src="images/4.4.jpg" alt="Yellow and brown butterfly" title="Yellow and brown butterfly" id="img4.4"/>

          <p class="caption">We know this beautiful butterfly as the tiger swallowtail. Specialists in <em>lepidopterology</em> (the study of moths and butterflies) might also know its <em>taxonomy</em> (its kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species). In the same way, if we are to be really skilled in educational instruction and assessment, we need to know how to classify our learning targets. Bloom&#39;s taxonomy of educational objectives and Gagn&#233;&#39;s learning outcomes are meant to help us do that.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Teaching for remembering might involve asking students to name, recognize, relate, recall, or reproduce. Similarly, an instructional procedure aimed at developing analytic skills might ask learners to appraise, compare and contrast, criticize, question, or differentiate.</p>
   
	<p class="txt">Taxonomies suggest various approaches to assessment. For example, each of the instructional tasks described in the preceding paragraph can be used as an assessment task. That is, if instruction has been directed toward developing the skills required for appraisal, criticism, and evaluation, formative assessment will be designed to provide feedback relating to how effectively these objectives are being met&#8212;feedback that can then be used to inform and to improve approaches to both learning and instruction. And summative assessments of the extent to which instructional objectives have been realized will ask learners to engage in tasks that require appraisal, criticism, and evaluation.</p>
     
    <p class="txt">One way of designing approaches to instruction and assessment is to list instructional objectives that correspond to one or more of the kinds of cognitive objectives described by taxonomies such as Bloom&#39;s or revisions thereof. A teacher might do this for an entire subject or perhaps for a unit or even for a single lesson.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Instructional objectives should specify the most important outcomes expected of learners.</p>
	</div>
	
  <a id="p162"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Examples</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Instructional objectives for a major unit on animal characteristics and habitats, based on Darwazeh&#39;s revision of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy, might be worded as follows:</p>

	<p class="txt">After the unit, the learner should be able to</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">List the defining characteristics of desert, tundra, rain forest, ocean, grassland, pond, deciduous forest, city, cave, . . . (<em>facts remembrance</em>).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Recall the characteristics of animals that live in wetlands; in deserts; in high mountains (<em>generalities remembrance</em>).</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Compare the characteristics of the most common animals in one habitat with the features of those more common in another (<em>comprehension</em>).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Explain the difference between the eyes of a predator and those of preyed-upon animals (<em>analysis</em>).</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Classify the most common animals in North America into family groups (<em>organization</em>).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Relate where animals live to patterns of human population (<em>synthesis</em>).</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Demonstrate how some habitats might be dangerous for certain animals but not for others (<em>application</em>).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Debate the relative value for humans of the flora and fauna in different habitats (<em>evaluation</em>).</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Design a new planet with a habitat that is not found on Earth, and invent one or more creatures that would be well adapted to this habitat (<em>creation</em>).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Summarize and evaluate the things that might be done to prepare for the end-of-unit test (<em>metacognition</em>).</li>
     </ul>

	 <p class="txt">Figure 4.3 lists a large number of verbs (many of them synonyms or near synonyms) associated with each of the 10 levels of the cognitive domain in Darwazeh&#39;s revision of Bloom&#39;s revised taxonomy. Verbs related to the psychomotor and affective domains are found in Figures 4.5 and 4.6. These verbs can easily serve as a guide for preparing lessons. In addition, they can provide suggestions for approaches to assessment.</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Different Cognitive Processes for Identical Tasks</h2>
	<div class="single-column">

	<p class="key-point">It&#39;s important to understand that the use of verbs such as <em>compare, contrast, test, differentiate, categorize</em>, and so on does not guarantee that a task will require higher level cognitive processes such as analyzing.</p>

	<p class="txt">In fact, it might require no more than the lowest level of cognitive activities. If, for example, the learner compares by rattling off well-memorized lists of similarities and differences, all that&#39;s being tapped is factual knowledge&#8212;the ability to recall.</p>

  <a id="p163"></a>
	<p class="txt">Similarly, if the relative value of flora and fauna in different habitats has already been summarized and given to learners as part of their electronic study material, asking them to debate this issue may not be very different from asking them to regurgitate previously learned material. On the other hand, if the learner has not memorized lists of similarities and differences and has not been exposed to arguments debating what different habitats contribute to human existence, the cognitive processes at play might well involve higher level skills such as analyzing and evaluating rather than simply remembering.</p>

	<p class="key-point">The important point is that what is being tested&#8212;the learning objectives at play&#8212;depends not so much on the wording of the tasks as on the relationship between the requirements of the assignment and the learner&#39;s previous knowledge.</p>

	<p class="txt">Consider, for example, this ridiculous task:</p>

	<p class="ext"><em>Explain how operant conditioning might be used to train a cow to fetch a stick.</em></p>

	<p class="txt">Assume that the teacher has previously explained in detail how trainers use operant conditioning to shape complex and impressive animal behaviors. She has presented videos of mules diving into small pools from impressive heights, horses rolling over on command, and pigs riding surfboards. If Jordan has been present, awake, and paying attention in class, and if he responds correctly to the task, the question has probably tapped his cognitive processes only at the level of simple remembrance.</p>

	<p class="txt">But if Jordan was absent, asleep, or otherwise preoccupied on the day of the original explanation, his correct response might result from a combination of higher level cognitive processes. These might include analysis: He breaks down the elements involved in operant conditioning, bringing into consideration the types and schedules of reinforcements used and the nature of the various responses required of the animal. His cognitive processes might also include application: He successfully applies the principles he has learned to a new situation. And they might involve evaluation: He judges the likely effectiveness of his approach. And, because this is all new to him, Jordan also manifests the ability to create. He has, in effect, invented shaping.</p>

    <p class="txt">The preceding paragraph illustrates two important points:</p>

	<ol class="nl">
		<li class="li_text">The learner&#39;s cognitive activity is determined by previous learning, motivation, and perhaps a variety of personality characteristics, not only by the nature of the task presented. Responding to a task might require one learner to make enormous efforts to understand, analyze, apply, and evaluate in order to finally succeed. Another learner might need to remember only a well-learned tidbit of factual information.</li>
		<li class="li_text">Cognitive activities are not always sequential or highly distinct, although it is a common misconception that they are. For example, when Jordan invented shaping, he needed to remember what operant conditioning is, analyze its components, apply its principles, and synthesize and evaluate various possibilities. But each of these activities would not necessarily occur only once, nor would they always happen in the same order.</li>

    <p class="intro">As we saw in Chapter 2, a test blueprint details how a test is to be built. It usually specifies the number and nature of the items to be used in the test and the skills and abilities that are to be tapped. A good blueprint might also describe how an assessment procedure might contribute to student learning.</p>

      <p class="txt">The blueprint shown in Table 4.4 is one of the simplest to devise. Other blueprints might be more complex and more detailed.

Actual test performances are then described in appropriate cells, and their weighted contribution to the final score is indicated.</p>

	  <p class="txt">The test blueprint in Table 4.5 reveals that the two topics listed are equally important (each contributes 50&#37; to the final grade).

      <p class="txt">Test blueprints can be devised in a number of other ways, some of them easier and more useful in certain subjects. In physical education classes, for example, taxonomies in the cognitive domain are not highly relevant, so teachers might simply make a list of the skills that students are expected to acquire. This list of skills, together with an indication of the criteria that will be used as evidence of skill mastery, serves as a test blueprint.</p>

	  <p class="txt">Similar test blueprints can be prepared for subjects such as art, drama, and music, in which knowledge and skills are most clearly expressed in actual performances. Detailed descriptions of the skills students are expected to acquire and of the level of proficiency expected can then serve as a basis for formal assessments. Performance-based assessments are described in detail in Chapter 7.</p>

      <p class="txt">Unfortunately, these sorts of test blueprints in physical education, art, drama, and music are rare. Most often, teachers rely on informal, intuitive assessments. And although such assessment is clearly needed, it is seldom as impartial as more formal assessment. Nor does it serve nearly as well as a source of feedback for instruction and learning.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Constructing Learning Hierarchies</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Gagn&#233;&#39;s description of intellectual skills is closely related to recent research on learning progressions, which he calls <strong>learning hierarchies</strong>. As we saw in Chapter 3, a learning progression, or hierarchy, is a sequence of skills or ideas arranged from simpler to more complex. The five subcategories that make up Gagn&#233;&#39;s intellectual skills are, in a sense, a hierarchical description of intellectual activities reflecting learning progressions in different fields of study. The underlying assumption is that learners who are most likely to benefit from instruction are those who have acquired requisite skills and knowledge.</p>

    <p class="txt">Constructing a learning hierarchy involves breaking down a unit of study into a hierarchy of knowledge, skills, and tasks that progress from simplest to increasingly complex. For example, Szadokierski, Burns, and McComas (2017) developed an instructional hierarchy to improve reading skills among second- and third-grade students. Similarly, Johnson and Tymms (2011) carried out a 3-year study with seventh- to ninth-grade students across 30 secondary schools (4,450 students) looking at children&#39;s growing understanding of chemistry. These authors, too, observed a clear learning progression in the emergence of increasingly complex ideas. As we see in the next chapter, this kind of analysis can be used as a basis for formative assessment.</p>

	<p class="txt">Of particular help in developing learning progressions is Gagn&#233;&#39;s (1985) notion of the nine events of instruction. These nine events are an idealized representation of nine sequential steps that represent good teaching and that are therefore associated with effective learning (White &#38; Gagn&#233;, 1974). These nine steps are shown in Figure 4.7 and are explained and illustrated in Table 4.7.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What are some limitations of taxonomies? What are some alternate models?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">Despite their usefulness, Bloom&#39;s taxonomy and revisions thereof, as well as Gagn&#233;&#39;s learning outcomes, have some weaknesses and limitations.</p>
	</div>

  <a id="p169"></a>
  <div class="section-body">
	<h2 class="h2">The Highest Level Is Not Always the Goal</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">For example, these taxonomies present a hierarchical arrangement of skills beginning with the lowest level&#8212;remembering&#8212;and progressing through increasingly advanced levels of thinking skills. One problem with this representation is the assumption that learners need to progress from the lowest level through increasingly higher levels until they finally reach the very top of the intellectual hierarchy. In fact, this is a common interpretation of taxonomies such as Bloom&#39;s and revisions thereof.</p>

    <p class="key-point">But in many fields of study, there is no need to progress through 6 or 10 hierarchical levels.</p>

	<p class="txt">If you need to learn how an impeller works in your mechanics course, you will not likely need to create one. Similarly, when you first learn to read, the emphasis will surely be on remembering and perhaps understanding rather than on analyzing, evaluating, and creating.</p>

	 <p class="key-point">So, although these systems serve the important function of reminding teachers and test makers that they need to pay attention to higher level mental processes, it is nevertheless true that some tasks and some forms of learning are accomplished more efficiently and more effectively at so-called lower levels of functioning.</p>
     </div>
	
  <div class="inner-section">
	 <h2 class="h2">Skills Are Not Always Distinct</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Another problem implicit in dividing intellectual functioning and learning outcomes into separate categories is that doing so makes things seem far more distinct than they often are. Although we can define <em>creating, evaluating</em>, and <em>analyzing</em> in ways that make them seem strikingly different, in practice they may not be very distinct. In fact, <em>thinking</em> will often involve all these processes in such a way that it becomes virtually impossible to separate them. Nor will they necessarily happen sequentially, as the model implies.</p>

	<p class="txt">In brief, our interpretation of these models, as is so often the case with the models we invent to explain phenomena in the social sciences, probably oversimplifies. Our cognitive processes are far more complex than simple models suggest.</p>
     </div>
	</div>

	 <h2 class="h2">Nonhierarchal Models</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Not all taxonomies of learning objectives are hierarchical. For example, Figure 4.1 simplifies matters by presenting a nonhierarchical list of four learning-related areas: knowledge, mental processes, practical skills, and productions. These four areas might be viewed as including all 10 of the distinct instructional objectives listed in Darwazeh&#39;s revision of Bloom&#39;s revised taxonomy. Similarly, Fink (2018) offers a &quot;taxonomy of significant learning&quot; that lists six nonhierarchical learning outcomes, some of which include important objectives not included in taxonomies such as the Bloom revisions.</p>

	<p class="txt">The Fink taxonomy, shown in Table 4.8, includes three classes of learning that correspond roughly to the Bloom taxonomy in the cognitive domain and revisions thereof: <em>foundational knowledge</em>, which involves comprehension and remembering; <em>application</em>, which includes practical, creative, and critical thinking; and <em>integration</em>, which relates to connecting ideas.</p>

  <a id="p170"></a>
	<p class="txt">The other three dimensions present a striking departure from other educational taxonomies: <em>human dimension</em> relates to understand the self and others and is evident in emotional intelligence; caring refers to the development of feelings, values, commitments, and interests; and <em>learning how to learn</em> has to do with becoming a self-regulated, autonomous learner.</p>

	<p class="txt">Because these classes of learning are not considered to be hierarchical, none is described as higher in terms of difficulty or as being more important than another. Fink argues that consideration of these categories of learning might assist educators in developing <em>significant</em> learning experiences not only in the three primarily cognitive domains (foundational knowledge and its application and integration) but, perhaps equally important, in the three domains relating to human relationships and self-knowledge (the human dimension, caring, and learning how to learn).</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Questions</span> <span class="focus_q">What is standards-based education? What are some different types of standards?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">Lists of classes of educational objectives provide educators with suggestions relating to what students are expected to learn. They guide teachers and school systems in setting learning objectives and devising assessment procedures.</p>
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Assessment plays a key role with regard to learning objectives. Assessment&#8212;both formal and informal&#8212;provides teachers with information concerning the readiness of learners before instruction (placement assessment); it provides important feedback both for teachers and for learners during instruction (formative assessment); and in the end, it serves to indicate the extent to which instructional objectives have been met (summative assessment). Although assessment is listed as the eighth step in Gagn&#233;&#39;s list of nine sequential instructional events, it should often be the first step . . . and maybe the third, fifth, seventh, and in between.</p>

  <a id="p171"></a>
    <p class="key-point">However, teachers do not simply decide on their own what students should know and be able to do.</p>

	<p class="txt">As we saw in Chapter 1, appropriate and acceptable <strong>standards</strong> are often established by national and state organizations. For example, most states have now adopted or adapted the <em>common core standards</em> developed by a national consortium of educators (Council of Chief State School Officers, 2017).</p>

	 <p class="txt">The terms <em>goals and standards</em>, as we saw earlier, are used interchangeably in this text to mean broad, idealistic general statements of the aims of education. Learning (or instructional) objectives are the more specific intentions and expectations that describe details of the knowledge and skills that are the specific objectives of a lesson or a unit (these terms are explained and illustrated in Table 1.5, Chapter 1).</p>

	<p class="txt"><strong>Standards-based education</strong>, education directed at reaching explicit levels of performance, has recently been a hot topic in educational circles. It is viewed as part of current educational reform, sometimes referred to as <em>standards-based reform</em>. It is evident in <em>standards-based grading systems</em>, whereby student performance is evaluated in terms of whether and how well a standard has been reached rather than in terms of a letter grade or numerical score. This reform movement is under way in many of the world&#39;s developed countries, including New Zealand, Australia, and many European countries, in addition to the United States; it dominates current education policy (Smithson, 2017).</p>

          <p class="cr">Jetta Productions/Photodisc/Getty Images Plus</p>
          <p class="caption">In the same way as schools might have dress standards, they also have academic standards. Standards might be explicit <em>content</em> standards that describe what it is that students should know or be able to do; others might be <em>performance</em> standards that specify what acceptable levels of performance are.</p>
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">There are different ways of looking at the meaning of educational standards. For example, Dr. Sam, a professor in an undergraduate measurement class, prides himself on having higher standards than other professors. To prove that he does, he routinely fails as many as 40&#37; of his students.</p>

	<p class="txt">Dr. Sam&#39;s main competitor in the race to have high standards is Dr. Jackson, an instructor who delights in successfully teaching difficult concepts. Her exams are typically far more difficult than Dr. Sam&#39;s, but few of her students actually fail her course. Whereas Dr. Sam continually moves his fail standard to ensure that enough students fail, Dr. Jackson moves hers so that most will pass. If you achieve 75&#37; on one of Dr. Sam&#39;s exams, you might well fail the course; 55&#37; on Dr. Jackson&#39;s tests, and you may be at the top of the class.</p>
	</div>
	
  <a id="p172"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	 <h2 class="h2">Content and Performance Standards</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The example of Dr. Sam and Dr. Jackson represents a clear distinction between <strong>content standards</strong> and <strong>performance standards.</strong></p>

	<p class="key-point">Content standards are defined in terms of what students should know. Performance standards specify criteria for acceptable performance in relation to content.</p>

	<p class="txt">For example, although the content standards in Dr. Sam&#39;s class are relatively undemanding, the performance standards are extraordinarily high: To pass, students have to demonstrate nearly total mastery of content. In contrast, the content standards in Dr. Jackson&#39;s class are very high, but performance standards deemed adequate are much lower; students need to master a smaller percentage of the content to achieve success.</p>

	<p class="txt">In some content areas, performance standards need to be exceptionally high. We expect our physicians and airline pilots to have mastered the skills and knowledge that define the content standards in their fields. It is probably best to avoid the pilot who has mastered 100&#37; of the skills required for taking off and flying but who has failed to learn that tiny portion having to do with landing!</p>
	</div>
	</div>
	
	 <h2 class="h2">Developmental Standards</h2>
	<div class="single-column">

	<p class="txt">In addition to content and performance standards, <strong>developmental standards</strong> have a useful place in instruction and assessment.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Developmental standards are descriptions of the expected or ideal progression through the steps leading to the final instructional goal.</p>

	<p class="txt">Suppose, for example, that one of your country&#39;s content standards is that all 12th-grade students should be proficient in mathematics. A related performance standard might specify that each learner should score at a given level on a standardized mathematics achievement test. And associated with this, there might also be a series of developmental standards that detail what acceptable performance would be at each grade level. Figure 4.8 summarizes these three types of standards.</p>

          <p class="caption">These different types of standards are not always very distinct in practice. Both <em>content</em> and <em>developmental</em> standards are often expressed in terms of the learner&#39;s actual <em>performance</em>. However, content standards, often based on national or state rulings, are typically developed before more specific performance and developmental standards and serve as a basis for them.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
    <p class="intro">As Figure 4.8 indicates, each of the three types of educational standards&#8212;content, performance, and developmental&#8212;can serve as a basis for educational reform.</p>
	</div>
  <div class="section-body">
  <div class="single-column">
      
    <p class="txt">For example, content standards, which indicate what students should know or be able to do, are often the basis for curriculum change. Similarly, developmental standards, which describe expected levels of progress, can lead to changes in instructional offerings. So too can performance standards, which specify required levels of performance.</p>

    <a id="p174"></a>
	 <p class="txt">Many national and state bodies have developed explicit sets of content (academic) standards&#8212;such as the common core standards, as well as developmental and performance requirements for learners. These requirements are closely linked to assessments designed to determine how well standards are being met. Ultimately, standards can determine or at least influence changes in approaches to learning, instruction, and assessment. That, essentially, defines standards-based educational reform.</p>
	</div>
 
	<div class="inner-section">
   <h2 class="h2">Dewey&#39;s Progressive Education Reform, Constructivism, and Direct Teaching</h2>
   <div class="single-column">
   <p class="txt">Reform is not new in education. Decades ago, John Dewey (1933) proposed radical changes that he labeled <strong>progressive education</strong>. This was essentially a reaction against traditional education, which viewed the teacher&#39;s role as one of imparting information and the learner&#39;s role as one of paying attention and absorbing as much as possible of the teacher&#39;s wisdom. Progressive education proposed that students should be actively involved in education&#8212;that they should not simply be the passive recipients of knowledge. The role of the progressive teacher was not so much to be a source of information but to facilitate and foster the learner&#39;s efforts.</p>
   
   <div class="text_container">
      <h4><button class="ec_expand" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ecbox4-3">LEARN MORE</button></h4>
      <div id="ecbox4-3">

        <p class="txt">The main tenets of progressive education have continued in various forms throughout the history of education in North America, although the labels for various approaches to education have changed periodically. And the call for change, for educational reform, has historically been opposed by the desire to maintain the <strong>status quo</strong>&#8212;to leave things as they are, whatever state that may be.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">A current label for an instructional model that corresponds roughly to Dewey&#39;s progressive education is <em>constructivism</em>. A contrasting model is called <em>direct teaching</em>. As we saw in Chapter 3, direct teaching describes a teaching model in which the teacher directs the student and serves as the primary source of information. Constructivist approaches reflect the belief that learners construct their own meanings and understanding rather than having these given to them (Lefran&#231;ois, 2018).</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Outcome-Based Reform and Mastery Education</h2>
   <div class="single-column">
   <p class="txt">Many years after the introduction of Dewey&#39;s progressive education, there appeared another reform movement, sometimes labeled <strong>outcome-based education</strong>. It advocated turning a faltering educational system around by paying more attention to its intended and observed outcomes. Outcome-based approaches to education tried to change the focus from input (the resources available to the student) to outcomes (measurable student performances). However, unlike the standards-based reform movement, its focus was mainly on increasing student performance rather than on establishing goals based on agreed-upon standards.</p>
   </div>
   <div class="text_container">
      <h4><button class="ec_expand" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ecbox4-4">LEARN MORE</button></h4>
      <div id="ecbox4-4">
	  <div class="single-column">

        <p class="txt">Outcome-based education has clear implications for assessment practices. If the effectiveness of education is to be judged in terms of its outcomes, then there is a need to develop the most valid and reliable ways of measuring outcomes. State- and federally mandated educational standards play an important role in providing guidance for describing desired educational outcomes (Lee, Liu, Amo, &#38; Wang, 2014).</p>
		
    <a id="p175"></a>
        <p class="txt">Another educational reform movement closely related to outcome-based education is <em>mastery education</em> described by Bloom (1987) and discussed in Chapter 5. Mastery education is based on the assumption that all learners are capable of mastering course objectives. Some are faster learners; others are slower. But none should be described as better or poorer.</p>

		<p class="txt">Many of the sentiments that moved progressive education, outcome-based education, and mastery education underlie what we now refer to as <em>standards-based</em> reform. Table 4.9 juxtaposes some of the different concepts and approaches that characterize these broad views of educational reform and of the status quo.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Common Standards and Educational Reform</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Current standards-based approaches to education are different from the older outcome-based approach in at least two important ways.</p>

	<ol class="nl">
	<li class="li_text">Perhaps most important, current legislation specifies that the new standards apply to <em>all</em> learners, no matter their economic, social, racial, or intellectual background. No one is to be excluded. Older reform movements were not always so inclusive, equitable, or fair.</li>
    <li class="li_text">The standards described in the legislation are much higher than standards historically have been in U.S. education. To the extent that reforms lead to the achievement of these standards, educational offerings might improve dramatically.</li>
	</ol>

<a id="p176"></a>
    <p class="txt">In a general sense, Dewey&#39;s <em>progressive education</em> label describes many aspects of reform movements that have come later, including outcome-based education, mastery learning, standards- based reform, and constructivism. Each of these reform movements reflects Dewey&#39;s notion that learners share an important responsibility for their learning&#8212;that they, in today&#39;s jargon, will be successful largely to the extent that they learn how to learn.</p>

	<p class="txt">But, suggests Hayes (2006), although the beliefs and attitudes that characterize progressive education continue to have an enormous influence on current educational practice, they are being threatened by standards-based programs. He argues that mandated state curriculum standards, and the high-stakes consequences that follow from their assessment, undermine progressive education&#39;s belief that teachers should be facilitators and learners should adopt a more active role. In effect, what Hayes fears is what we referred to in Chapter 2 as <em>Campbell&#39;s law</em>&#8212;the observation that, as a social indicator such as high-stakes achievement testing becomes progressively more important, it is increasingly likely to lose its value and its intended effect.</p>

	<p class="txt">Why might Campbell&#39;s law apply to standards-based educational reform? Simply because increasing demands for school accountability may add to the likelihood that teachers will spend more of their time <em>narrowing</em> the curriculum and <em>teaching to the test</em>, trying to ensure that students learn the material that is most likely to be on the state-administered test. And if doing so means that the learner must again assume a more passive, receptive role, the casualty may be those aspects of educational reform most concerned with the development of independent, self-regulated learners.</p>

    <div class="single-column">
      <h3 class="h3"> Learning Objectives</h3>
      <p class="txt"><em>Goals</em> and <em>standards</em> (used interchangeably here) are broad, idealistic statements that reflect desirable outcomes of the educational process. Criteria are levels of knowledge or skills that can be used as a basis for comparison and assessment. Instructional (<em>or learning</em>) objectives are specific statements of actual behaviors or performances expected (desired) of learners. The most useful instructional objectives are <strong>s</strong>pecific, <strong>m</strong>easurable, <strong>a</strong>ttainable, <strong>r</strong>elevant, and <strong>t</strong>imely (SMART).</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Bloom&#39;s Revised Taxonomy: Cognitive Domain</h3>
      <p class="txt">Bloom&#39;s taxonomy is a widely known list of six categories of educational objectives in the cognitive, psychomotor, and affective domains. Anderson and Krathwohl&#39;s revision of Bloom&#39;s taxonomy uses verbs to describe each of Bloom&#39;s six cognitive categories and places <em>creating</em> at the highest level. Darwazeh&#39;s revision divides the lowest level, knowledge, into four categories, and lists 10 hierarchical classes of objectives. These taxonomies are designed to assist teachers in the task of developing instructional objectives and related assessments.</p>

      <a id="p177"></a>
      <h3 class="h3">The Psychomotor and Affective Domains</h3>
      <p class="txt">The psychomotor domain deals with physical motor skills often measured in terms of speed, accuracy, and coordination. A taxonomy of psychomotor objectives describes sequential activities related to <em>observing</em> (watching), <em>imitation</em> (modeling), <em>manipulation</em> (practicing early skills), <em>precision</em> (more advanced skills), <em>adaptation</em> (highly developed skills), and <em>origination</em> (natural-looking skills). Objectives in the affective domain include <em>receiving</em> (listening), <em>responding</em> (asking, discussing), <em>valuing</em> (explaining, defending), <em>organizing</em> (synthesizing, analyzing), and <em>internalizing</em> (making values-based decisions).</p>

	  <h3 class="h3">Uses of Taxonomies in Education</h3>
      <p class="txt">Taxonomies of objectives suggest useful instructional and assessment activities for the teacher. They can easily serve as blueprints for test construction. For example, test items can be devised that tap each of the cognitive objectives in Bloom&#39;s taxonomy. Gagn&#233;&#39;s <em>learning outcomes</em> is another useful approach to listing instructional objectives. However, contrary to what might be implied by Bloom&#39;s taxonomy and Gagn&#233;&#39;s list of learning outcomes, cognitive activities are not always sequential or highly distinct. Nor does the wording of an item or of an instructional task guarantee that it will tap the same cognitive processes in all learners. Fink presents a six-category, nonhierarchical taxonomy of <em>significant learning</em>. It includes three categories not included in the Bloom revisions: learning how to learn, caring, and human dimension.</p>

	  <h3 class="h3">Standards, Objectives, and Educational Reform</h3>
      <p class="txt">Standards-based education is directed toward reaching explicit standards&#8212;norms that specify an expected or acceptable level of performance or knowledge. <em>Content</em> standards describe what students should know; <em>performance</em> standards specify what an acceptable level of performance is; <em>developmental</em> standards indicate expected performance at different age or grade levels. Standards mandated by laws and regulations, often statewide or even national, underlie efforts toward <em>standards-based educational reform</em>&#8212;a relatively recent educational reform movement historically linked with Dewey&#39;s progressive education.</p>
