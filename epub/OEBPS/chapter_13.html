	<p class="txt">You will spend a lot of time, effort, and money earning your college degree. One of the best ways to ensure that your investment of these resources pays off is to have a realistic plan for what you will do after graduation. Many students feel that career planning is something they can put off&mdash;especially when they first start college&mdash;but it is never too early to start thinking about what you might do later, even if that thinking is general. </p>


	<p class="txt">Career planning begins with figuring out what fields would be a good fit for you. What topics interest you? What makes you happy and excited? Answering these types of questions can help direct your decisions both while in school and as you embark on your career. For example, if you want to work outside and with animals, you may not want to pursue a degree in accounting. There are a variety of ways to start assessing your interests and planning for your career, including taking formal and informal assessments, volunteering or taking internships in the fields you find interesting, or even interviewing people currently working in those fields. </p>


	<p class="txt">No matter what career field you explore and choose, you will need to have particular skill sets that help you be the best employee you can be. Every job has skill sets that are unique to the role being performed, but there are also more general skills that most employers look for. Often called soft skills, these include communication, cooperation, and teamwork. To become a valued employee, you have to bring both types of skill sets to work with you, so you need to become aware of these expected skill sets and start practicing them now. </p>

			<p class="txt">Approaching your career with a plan in mind can help you apply some concrete steps to figuring out where you might fit into the work world. Even if you already have a job, or even a career, you will still need a plan if you want to move into a new role or start a new career path. </p>


			<p class="txt">Career planning is not something you do only once at the start of your career; career planning is an ongoing process of checking in with yourself to evaluate where you are and where you want to be in your career. You can make this ongoing process easier by creating a deliberate plan for your career path and career development known as a <strong>career road map </strong>(seeFigure 13.1). </p>

		   </figure>



			 
			 <p class="txt">Road maps can vary, but essentially your road map should include the following cyclical steps to help you decide whether you want to change career paths and guide you in searching for a new job: </p>


			<ol class="nl">
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Know yourself.</strong> Like career planning, self-assessment is an ongoing process. Take the time to do some self-reflecting, retake formal assessments (you may even want to compare your new results to previous results), and check in with your family, friends, and coworkers. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Explore your options.</strong> Read about and explore different types of jobs and careers. Given the speed at which the employment market changes, there are likely to be new roles and even entirely new jobs and careers since the last time you looked! </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Assess and gain needed knowledge and experience.</strong> Consider what new skills you may need in order to transition into a new job or career. Do you need to go back to school? Become certified in a new skill set? Would joining a new professional group help? Map out the steps you would need to take to meet these needs.  </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>  <a id="p198"></a>Prepare for the job search.</strong> Create an up-to-date, applicant tracking system&ndash;friendlyversion of your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. Remember that each time you apply for a position, youshould optimize this r&eacute;sum&eacute; for your intended position. If the job posting asks for acover letter, be sure to tailor that to the position as well. For best results, make sure toidentify resources that relate to your desired field and determine where positions inthat field are likely to be posted. Depending on how long you&rsquo;ve been in your currentrole, you may also want to brush up on your interviewing skills. </li>
			</ol>
			
			<p class="txt">You don&rsquo;t need to check in constantly to make effective use of your road map, but you should plan to assess your current career, including your personal and professional interests and your level of satisfaction, on a regular basis. For some people this will be every year, whereas for others it may be every 3 to 5 years. Your interests and life circumstances will change over time, so it works in your interest to make sure your career meets your personal and professional goals! </p>


			<h2 class="h2">Know Yourself </h2>

			  </figure>
		

			<p class="txt">To understand what type of work suits you and to be able to convey that to others to get hired, you need to become an expert in knowing who you are. Gaining self-knowledge is a lifelong process, and college is the perfect time to gain and adapt this fundamental information. Following are some of the types of information you should have about yourself. </p>


		  <ul class="bl">

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Interests:</strong> Things you like and want to know more about. These often take the form of ideas, information, knowledge, and topics. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Skills/aptitudes:</strong> Things you either do well or can do well. These can be natural or learned and are usually skills&mdash;things you can demonstrate in some way. Some of our skills are hard skills, which are specific to jobs and/or tasks. Others are soft skills, which are personality traits and/or interpersonal skills that accompany you from position to position.</li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Values:</strong> The basic beliefs that guide our thinking and actions. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Personality:</strong> Things that combine to make you distinctive. Often, this shows in the way you present yourself to the world. Aspects of personality are customarily described as qualities, features, thoughts, and behaviors. </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">In addition to knowing the things you can do and like to do, you must also know how well you do them. What are your strengths? When employers hire people, they hire them to do something, to contribute to their organization in some way. Employees get paid for what they know, what they can do, and how well or deeply they can demonstrate these things. Think of these as your knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs). As a working person, you can think of yourself as carrying a &ldquo;tool kit&rdquo; with the KSAs you bring to each job. As you gain experience, you learn how best to use these tools. You will gain more tools and use some more often than others, but all the tools you gather during your career stay with you in some form.</p>

			 
  <a id="p199"></a>
			 <p class="txt">Because you&rsquo;re expected to spend your time in college focusing on what you learn in your classes, it might seem like a lot of extra work to also develop your career identity. Actually, the ideal time to learn about who you are as a worker and a professional is while you are so focused on learning and personal development, which lends itself to growth in all forms. College helps you acquire and develop your KSAs daily through your coursework and experiences. What might be some ways you can purposefully and consciously learn about yourself? How might you get more information about who you are? And how might you learn about what that means for your career? Awareness of the need to develop your career identity and your vocational worth is a good first step. Next, undertaking a process that is mindful and systematic can help guide you through. This process will help you look at yourself and the work world in a different way. During your studies, some of your professors and advisors may integrate career development into the curriculum, either formally or informally. Perhaps most significantly, the career services department at your school is an essential resource. It has advisors, counselors, and coaches who are formally trained in facilitating the career-development process. </p>


			<p class="txt">Career assessment is one way to increase your self-knowledge. It is most often designed to help you gain insight more objectively. You may want to think of assessment as a way to pull information out of yourself and put it back together in a way that applies to your career. Career assessments consist of both formal and informal assessments. </p>


		
			<h3 class="h3">Formal Assessments </h3>

			<p class="txt">Formal assessments are typically referred to as &ldquo;career tests.&rdquo; Thousands of these tests are available, and you can find many of them randomly on the Internet. While many of these can be fun, &ldquo;free&rdquo; and easily available assessments are usually not credible. It is important that you use assessments developed to be reliable and valid. Look to your school&rsquo;s career services team for their recommendations; their staff has often spent a good deal of time selecting instruments they believe work best for students. </p>


			<p class="txt">In addition to the self-assessments covered in Chapter 4 of this text, the following are some useful and commonly used formal assessments. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Interest assessments:</strong> Strong Interest Inventory, Campbell Interest and Skill Survey, Harrington&ndash;O&rsquo;Shea Career Decision-Making System </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Personality measures:</strong> Keirsey Temperament Sorter, TypeFocus </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Career planning software:</strong> SIGI 3, FOCUS 2 </li>
			</ul>


			<h3 class="h3">Informal Assessments </h3>

			<p class="txt">Often, asking questions and seeking answers can help provide you with valuable information. When you start working consciously on learning more about any subject, things that you never before considered may become apparent. Happily, this applies to self-knowledge as well. Outside of career testing, you can use a combination of self-reflection and enlisting others to learn more about yourself. Note that many of these approaches are similar to those used in deciding on a college major; self-reflection and conferring with others are often helpful when making any big decisions. </p>

 <a id="p200"></a>

			<h4 class="h4"><strong>Self-Reflection </strong></h4>

			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Notice when you do something that you enjoy or did particularly well. What did that feel like? What about it made you feel positive? Is it something you&rsquo;d like to do again? What was the impact you made through your actions? </li>

			<li class="li_text">Most people are the &ldquo;go-to&rdquo; person for something. What do you find that people come to you for? Are you good at giving advice? Do you tend to be a good listener, observing first and then speaking your mind? Do people appreciate your repair skills? Are you good with numbers? What role do you play in a group? </li>

			<li class="li_text">If you like to write or record your thoughts, consider creating a career journal that you update regularly, whether weekly or by semester. If writing your own thoughts is difficult, seek out guided activities that help prompt you to reflect. </li>
			</ul>



			<h4 class="h4"><strong>Enlisting Others </strong></h4>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Ask people who know you to tell you what they think your strengths are. This information can come from friends, classmates, professors, advisors, family members, coaches, mentors, and others. What kinds of things have they observed you doing well? What personal qualities do you have that they value? You are not asking them to tell you what career you should be in; rather, you are looking to learn more about yourself. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Find a mentor&mdash;such as a professor, an alumnus, an advisor, or a community leader&mdash;who shares a value with you and from whom you think you could learn new things. Perhaps they can share new ways of doing something or help you form attitudes and perceptions you believe would be helpful. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Get involved with one or more activities or groups available through your college that will let you use skills outside of the classroom. You will be able to learn more about how you work with a group and try new things that will add to your skill set. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Attend activities that will help you meet people (often alumni) who work in the professional world. Hearing their career stories will help you learn about where you might want to be. Do you share qualities with them that show you may be on a similar path to success? Can you envision yourself where they are? </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">No one assessment can tell you exactly what career is right for you; the answers to your career questions are not in a test. The reality of career planning is that it is a discovery process that uses many methods over time to strengthen your career knowledge and belief in yourself. </p>


			<h2 class="h2">Explore Your Options </h2>

			<p class="txt">While one of the most important decisions you will make in college is choosing your major, even more important is determining the type of knowledge you would like to have, understanding what you value, and learning how you can apply this in the workplace after you graduate. For example, if you know you like to help people, this is a value. If you also know that you&rsquo;re interested in math and/or finances, you might study to be an accountant. To combine both of these, you would gain as much knowledge as you can about financial systems and personal financial habits so that you can provide greater support and better help to your clients. </p>


			<p class="txt">The four factors of self-knowledge (interests, skills/aptitudes, values, and personality) that manifest in your KSAs are also the factors on which employers evaluate your suitability for a position. They consider what you can bring to their organization that both aligns with their organization&rsquo;s standards and fulfills a need not currently met by their existing workforce. Along with this, each job has KSAs that define it. Figure 13.2 presents a visual of this overlap between the elements of a position and the attributes you have to offer. </p>


<a id="p201"></a>

			<p class="txt">The importance of finding the right fit cannot be overstated. Many people don&rsquo;t realize that the KSAs of the person and the requirements of the job have to match to get hired in a given field. What is even more important, though, is that when a particular job fits your four factors of self-knowledge and maximizes your KSAs, you are most likely to be satisfied with your work! The &ldquo;fit&rdquo; works to help you not only get the job but also enjoy the job. </p>


			<p class="txt">If you have already done the work to learn about yourself, the next step is to determine the job factors. To do this, you need to have workplace knowledge. This involves understanding what employers in the workplace and specific jobs require. Aspects of workplace knowledge include the following. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Labor market information:</strong> Economic conditions, including the availability of and demand for jobs and the types of industries in a geographic area or market. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Industry details:</strong> Characteristics of the industry; trends and opportunities for both industry and employers; industry standards and expectations. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Work roles:</strong> Characteristics and duties of specific jobs and work roles; knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to perform the work; training and education required; certifications or licenses; compensation; promotion and career path; hiring process. </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">This &ldquo;research&rdquo; may sound a little dry and uninteresting at first, but consider it as a look into your future. If you are excited about what you are learning and what your career prospects are, learning about the places where you may put all of your hard work into practice should also be very exciting! Most professionals spend many hours not only performing their work but also being physically located at work. For something that is such a large part of your life, it will help you to know what you are getting into as you get closer to realizing your career goals.</p>

<a id="p202"></a>

			<h2 class="h2">Gain Workplace Knowledge </h2>

			<p class="txt">You have many ways to gain workplace knowledge, and you should avoid limiting yourself to just one or two options. As with any sort of knowledge-gaining endeavor, you should approach gaining workplace knowledge as an opportunity to gather both a breadth and depth of information. After all, the more you can learn, the better prepared you will be. The following are just a few recommendations to get you started. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Learn the &ldquo;textbook&rdquo; definitions of what is involved in the jobs you are considering. Consult sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; <em>Occupational Outlook Handbook</em> to learn more about the requirements for occupations and the U.S. Department of Labor&rsquo;s My Next Move to learn about more specific job titles. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Read online information relevant to the professions in which you are interested. Good sources for this include professional associations. Just &ldquo;googling&rdquo; information is risky; you should look for professional and credible information. The <em>Occupational Outlook Handbook</em> has links to many of these sources. Your school&rsquo;s career services department can also guide you. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Whether you are just choosing your major or are already in a major and want to know what options it offers in terms of future work, look for this specific information. Your school&rsquo;s career services department should have this information. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Join professional clubs in your area. Many of these organizations have guest speakers who come to meetings and talk about what their jobs are like. Often, they also sponsor field trips to different companies and organizations. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Attend networking events and programs such as job fairs and recruiting information sessions so you can talk to people who actually do the work and get their insights. (Networks and networking, including types, resources, and strategies, will be covered in more detail in Chapter 14.)</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">Something to keep in mind as you make choices about your major and career is that the training is not the job. What you learn in your college courses is often foundational information; it provides basic knowledge you need for more complex concepts and tasks. For example, say a second-year student who is premed has the interests and qualities that may make them a good physician, but they are struggling to pass basic chemistry. They start to think that medical school is no longer an appropriate goal because of this. Does it make sense to abandon a suitable career path because of one course? In some ways, yes. In the case of medical school, the degree path is so long and intensive that if the student can&rsquo;t persevere through one introductory course, they may not have the determination to complete the training. On the other hand, if you are truly dedicated to your path, don&rsquo;t let one difficult course deter you. You may just need a different perspective to understand the connection between the lessons in the difficult chemistry course and a profession in medicine. Professors are good people to ask for this alternate viewpoint. </p>


<a id="p203"></a>


			<h2 class="h2">Try Things Out </h2>


			<p class="txt">In the first three steps of the career road map, you gather information. You may have some ideas about jobs and careers that you may like, but you may also wonder if you will really like them. How will you know? How can you be more certain? Perhaps the best way is to take an interest or a skill and try it out in an experience. By putting your skills and interests to work in any one of a number of different environments, you can get practice and learn more about who you are and just how much you can do. It&rsquo;s a great idea to try out a new skill or career field before you commit to it fully. You might find out that the field isn&rsquo;t right for you, but you also may find that you are heading in the right direction and want to keep pursuing it. Experiences help you become more qualified for positions. One exciting aspect of college is that you have a huge variety of learning experiences and activities at your disposal. The following are some ways you can try things out and get experience. </p>


			
			<h3 class="h3">Community Involvement, Volunteering, and Clubs </h3>

			<p class="txt">One of the reasons you&rsquo;re in college is to develop yourself as an individual. You&rsquo;ll gain personally satisfying and enriching experiences by becoming more involved with your college or general community. Organizations, clubs, and charities often rely on college students because of their motivation, knowledge, and increasing maturity. The work can increase your skills and abilities, providing valuable experience that will lead to positive results. </p>


			<p class="txt">Participate in clubs and volunteer in areas that appeal to your interests and passions. It&rsquo;s just as important to enjoy these activities and make a difference as it is to increase your career potential through networking and skill building. Once you join a club or related organization, take the time to learn about their leadership opportunities. Many clubs and organizations have some type of management structure&mdash;treasurer, vice president, president, and so on. You may &ldquo;move up the ranks&rdquo; naturally, or you may need to apply or even run for election. Some organizations, such as political campaigns and parent&ndash;teacher associations, have skill-based semiprofessional positions or roles such as information technology specialist, researcher, or donations coordinator. These opportunities may not always be available to you at first, but you can take on shorter term roles to build your skills and make a bigger impact. Perhaps you can assist a person in one of these roles as a way to learn more. Managing a fund-raiser, planning an event, or temporarily taking on a role while someone else is busy are all ways to engage further. </p>


			<p class="txt">Volunteering can be an important way to access a profession and get a sense of whether you will enjoy it, even before you do an internship. And in certain arenas, such as politics, it might be the only readily accessible approach, especially if you have no prior experience. In all of these cases, you can build important skills and increase your experience working with people in your chosen field. Spend time reflecting on and recording your experiences so that you&rsquo;re better prepared to talk about them and utilize what you learned. </p>




			<h3 class="h3">Internships and Related Experiences </h3>

			<p class="txt">Many employers value experience as much as they do education. Internships and similar fieldwork allow you to use what you&rsquo;ve learned and, sometimes more importantly, see how things work &ldquo;in the real world.&rdquo; These experiences drive you to communicate with others in your field and help you understand the day-to-day challenges and opportunities of people working in similar areas. Even if the internship is not at a company or organization directly in your field of study, you&rsquo;ll focus on gaining transferable skills that you can apply later on. </p>

<a id="p204"></a>

			<p class="txt">Speaking to career or academic advisors and planning your major will help you learn about internship requirements and recommendations. You&rsquo;ll find out how, where, and when to apply, the level of commitment required, and any limitations or guidelines your college indicates. If you&rsquo;re going to receive college credit for your internship or fieldwork, it must be directly related to your field of study. </p>


			<p class="txt">When you intern, you are usually treated as if you work at the company full time. It&rsquo;s not just learning about the job; it&rsquo;s <em>doing</em> the job, often similarly to an entry-level employee. The level of commitment may vary by the type of internship and may be negotiable based on your schedule. Be very clear about what&rsquo;s required and what you can handle given your other commitments, because you want to leave a very good impression. Internship managers can be your top resource for employment references and letters of recommendation. </p>


			<p class="txt">Note that while internships and similar positions may seem to involve low-level work, you maintain your rights and should be treated properly. Getting coffee, organizing shelves, and copying papers may be part of the work, but your internship should also be structured with more discipline-specific duties, responsibilities, and goals for learning that are mutually agreed on by both you and the internship site, as well as approved by an internship supervisor from your college or university. This will help ensure a positive and productive experience for both you and your internship sponsor. </p>


			<p class="txt">Students who take internships generally report them to be worthwhile experiences. In a 2018 survey of students taken by NACE, approximately 75% of students said their professionalism/work ethic, teamwork/collaboration, and oral/written communication skills were &ldquo;very&rdquo; to &ldquo;extremely&rdquo; improved by their internship/co-op experience, and 66% said the same of their critical thinking/problem-solving skills. </p>


			<p class="txt">There are many and varied types of experiential learning opportunities that can help you learn more about different career opportunities. Table 13.1 provides a brief overview. </p>

		<tr>
		<td><strong>Internship</strong></td>
		<td>A period of work experience in a professional organization in which participants (interns) are exposed to and perform some of the tasks of actual employees. Internships are usually a relatively high-commitment experience and may be paid and/or result in college credit.</td>
		</tr>


		<tr>
		<td><strong>Externship/job shadowing</strong></td>
		<td>Usually a briefer and lower commitment experience than internships in which participants are observing work activities and perhaps undertaking small projects. Unpaid and not credit bearing. </td>
			</tr>

		<tr>
		<td><strong>Fieldwork</strong></td>
		<td>A period or trip to conduct research or participate in the &ldquo;natural environment&rdquo; of a discipline or profession. Fieldwork may involve visiting a work site, such as a hospital or nursing home, or being a part of a team gathering data or information. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
		<td><a id="p205"></a><strong>Apprenticeship </strong></td>
		<td>A defined period of on-the-job training in which the student is formally doing the job and learning specific skills. Unlike most internships, apprenticeships are usually formal requirements to attain a license or gain employment in skilled trades. </td>

		<tr>
		<td><strong>Undergraduate research </strong></td>
		<td>Even as an undergrad, you may find opportunities to partake in actual research in your field of study. Colleges often have strict guidelines on types and levels of participation, and you will likely need to apply. The benefits include firsthand knowledge of a core academic activity and exposure to more people in your field. </td>

		<tr>
		<td><strong>Clinicals, student teaching, and related experiences</strong></td>
		<td>Health care, education, and other fields often have specific requirements for clinicals (learning experience in health care facilities) or student teaching. These are often components of the major and are required for both graduation and licensure. </td>
		</tr>

		<tr>
		<td><strong>Service learning</strong></td>
		<td>Students learn educational standards through tackling real-life problems in their community. Involvement could be hands-on, such as working in a homeless shelter. Students could also tackle broad issues in an indirect manner, such as by solving a local environmental problem. </td>

        <h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Try It: Searching for Internships</strong></h4>
        <div class="aside_content">
 
			<p class="txt">Go to the website <a class="link"  href="https://www.internships.com/" target="_blank">https://www.internships.com/</a> and enter a specific keyword and location in the fields on the home page, such as &ldquo;physical therapy&rdquo; and &ldquo;Bend, OR.&rdquo; How many opportunities came back? How many piqued your interest? </p>


			<p class="txt">Now try to choose a broader, less specific keyword. For example, instead of &ldquo;physical therapy,&rdquo; try &ldquo;health care&rdquo; on the second search. Did you receive more opportunities the second time? Do you see ones that aren&rsquo;t exactly in your field but that still seem interesting? </p>


			<p class="txt">On sites like these, you can play with the options and filters to find a wide array of internship possibilities in related fields. In the previous example, a future physical therapist who took an internship in another area of health care would certainly still learn a lot. </p>

			<h2 class="h2">Prepare for the Job Search </h2>

			<p class="txt">As you create, revise, and maintain your career road map, think of how you are going to present your accomplishments and career goals to others. Your <strong>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</strong> is a document with one specific purpose: to secure an interview with an intended employer. You have to make sure that your r&eacute;sum&eacute; helps you stand out among other applicants while succinctly conveying all the accurate information about how your qualifications and experience make you a strong fit for the position. </p>

<a id="p206"></a>

			<p class="txt">Almost every r&eacute;sum&eacute; nowadays will be prevetted by an <strong>applicant tracking system (ATS)</strong>. This software helps hiring managers narrow down the list of qualified applicants for a given position. According to Glassdoor (2015), an online job search and recruiting site, on average, corporate job offers attract 250 r&eacute;sum&eacute;s for one position. And because recruiters are typically hiring for multiple positions at once, they cannot review every r&eacute;sum&eacute; submitted. Instead, they rely on an ATS to provide them with a list of candidates whose r&eacute;sum&eacute;s most closely match the job listing. ATSs scan r&eacute;sum&eacute;s for hard and soft skills that align with the job listing&mdash;in general, they flag r&eacute;sum&eacute;s that match the job listing to a certain percentage (usually 80% or higher). You could be the most qualified candidate for a listed position, but if you do not optimize your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, it&rsquo;s likely you will never be called to interview. </p>


			<p class="txt">In today&rsquo;s job market, candidates should have one base r&eacute;sum&eacute; that they optimize for each position for which they apply. To optimize your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, compare it to the job listing. If the listing seeks a candidate with &ldquo;oral/written communication skills,&rdquo; be certain that you have that soft skill listed on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; (as long as you are proficient in oral/written communication). Do this for each qualification you have that the employer is seeking. It&rsquo;s rare that you will have every qualification listed, but you should notice significant correlation as you optimize. </p>


			<p class="txt">The following tips can help you make sure your r&eacute;sum&eacute; is the best it can be so you move beyond the r&eacute;sum&eacute; and cover letter to impressing the interview team with your personality and professionalism. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Optimize your r&eacute;sum&eacute; for each job to which you apply. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Make certain to use an ATS-friendly r&eacute;sum&eacute; format. For help with this, contact your university career services team or use resources like <a href="#" class="link">Jobscan</a>. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Include a summary of qualifications or a professional summary&mdash;objective statements are no longer standard practice in r&eacute;sum&eacute; writing. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Include your contact information with a working phone number and email address. </li>

			<li class="li_text">If you are an entry-level candidate, try to keep your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to one page; it is acceptable for mid- to high-level candidates to have a two-page r&eacute;sum&eacute;. </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">Although cover letters are becoming less and less common in the job market, if an employer asks for one, you should assume it will be closely examined. An employer may use your cover letter to assess your formal writing skills. In your cover letter, elaborate on any knowledge, skills, or abilities that make you a great fit for the position. You can also discuss how your values align with the employer&rsquo;s culture or mission. Beyond that, you can cite specific accomplishments or projects that demonstrate skills the employer is seeking. Keep in mind that your cover letter is your chance to <em>add</em> details on points in your r&eacute;sum&eacute;, not to restate those points. </p>


			<p class="txt">Probably the most important element to remember is that your r&eacute;sum&eacute; must contain no errors. Be sure to write it carefully, ask others for input, and proofread it several times before you submit it. One easy way for reviewers to sort through too many r&eacute;sum&eacute;s is to eliminate any with errors, which means your chance could be trashed before yours is even read carefully if the reviewer catches a typo or a formatting glitch you did not. If you can, use r&eacute;sum&eacute; optimization software to compare your r&eacute;sum&eacute; to the job listing. If you have trouble with optimizing your r&eacute;sum&eacute; or need additional guidance, reach out to the career services team at your university&mdash;they will likely have use of r&eacute;sum&eacute; optimization software. </p>

			<p class="txt">When you&rsquo;re juggling the busy life of a college student with all the expectations of life outside of school, you may look forward to a time after college when you can &ldquo;just&rdquo; go to work. And while your college life and your professional life will be different, you will continue to learn and improve your skills. That&rsquo;s how you become an even better employee and professional. Doctors don&rsquo;t just learn everything there is to know about medicine in college and stop learning when they go into practice. They continue to learn and keep up with the latest knowledge in their field. The same goes for teachers, engineers, and marketing professionals. You wouldn&rsquo;t have too much trust in a tax attorney who uses tax codes from years ago when he was in college or in a software engineer who doesn&rsquo;t know about email! Things change all the time, and this affects the way people do their jobs. If you don&rsquo;t continue improving your original skill sets, they will become obsolete in the same way rotary phones, record players, and horse-drawn buggies have. </p>


			<p class="txt">Every profession requires its own set of specific or &ldquo;hard&rdquo; skills, many of which you will learn in your college courses and through any relevant volunteering or job experience. However, while your strong grasp of field-specific skills and knowledge will get you pretty far, you must also master an array of &ldquo;soft&rdquo; skills that showcase your ability to communicate, make ethical decisions, lead, collaborate with others, use digital technology, manage your own career, think critically, and participate in a global and intercultural work environment. </p>


			<h2 class="h2">What Is a Skill Set, and How Do I Get One? </h2>

			<p class="txt">As discussed in the previous section, you must understand what specific sets of skills you can offer an employer. A skill set includes your KSAs, talents you can offer to an organization to help it succeed, and personal traits such as a positive attitude or a strong work commitment. </p>


			<p class="txt">A skill set is different from your personality, your psychological type, or your temperament. Think of your skill set as the traits you might include on your r&eacute;sum&eacute; that say, &ldquo;This is what I can do, and these are the abilities I can bring to your company.&rdquo; Not all the characteristics, interests, talents, and gifts you identified in your self-assessments will be part of this skill set. </p>


			<p class="txt">For example, you may have a musical talent, but you may use that talent as a hobby you engage in outside of work for your own personal enjoyment and the enjoyment of family and friends. The skill set you identify must meet the following three criteria. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">It must consist of characteristics, abilities, interests, talents, gifts, and preferences you most enjoy using on the job. </li>

			<li class="li_text">It must represent transferable skills&mdash;such as organizing or leading others&mdash;that you have learned and then successfully applied in your previous jobs and personal experiences. Once you have demonstrated that skill, you can easily transfer it from one job or career field to another. Adding to your skill set and developing your skills further happens through further education and work experience. </li>

			<li class="li_text">It must include job-specific skills you have acquired, such as the ability to use a computer, fix mechanical or digital equipment, communicate well with other people, or operate a cash register. </li>
			</ul>

  <a id="p208"></a>



			<h2 class="h2">Hard Skills Versus Soft Skills </h2>


			<p class="txt">Employers often look for two different types of skill sets in potential employees: hard skills and soft skills. <strong>Hard skills</strong> are abilities or skill sets that a person can learn or be trained to obtain. The skills include those acquired when you obtained a degree or certificate in a specific academic field, proficiency in a foreign language, or specific computer skills. These skills are fairly easy to recognize and would be ones you might list on your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. </p>


			<p class="txt"><strong>Soft skills</strong> are those skills that characterize your relationships with other people or dictate how you approach life and work. They are developed over time and with practice, and they cannot simply be learned in a college class. The good news is that with some self-awareness, you can identify where to focus your energy on learning and enhancing your soft skills. Every interaction you have is an opportunity to practice your soft skills. </p>


			<p class="txt">Think back to when you were a child. In addition to getting a report card with letter grades, you probably also got comments such as &ldquo;Works well with others&rdquo; or &ldquo;Has difficulty turning work in on time.&rdquo; While those comments may not have impacted your final grades, they did influence your ability to function as a productive member of your class. What you might not have known at the time is that your teachers were helping you develop soft skills. In adulthood, these basic childhood lessons manifest themselves as the soft skills of interpersonal communication, integrity, collaboration, flexibility, responsibility, and professionalism. </p>


			<p class="txt">Unlike hard skills, which are connected to a specific knowledge base, soft skills cut across all careers, serving as the mortar that bonds the building blocks of education, experience, and self-awareness into a well-structured career. Many college students and professionals fall into the trap of thinking they need only hard skills&mdash;job-specific knowledge&mdash;to further their career, when often it is soft skills that can make or break their advancement and expand or limit their potential. </p>


			<p class="txt">Companies are also beginning to recognize that hiring employees with established soft skills better positions them to innovate and perform and create cultures with high morale. Consider choosing a doctor. Would you rather see (or be seen by) the one who takes time to explain and listen to you or the one who just hands you a prescription and tells you to call the nurse with questions? </p>


			<p class="txt">Recruiters and employment experts are reporting a &ldquo;soft skills gap&rdquo; among job candidates (Feffer, 2016). Developing yours can help you stand out from the crowd and improve your relationships with those around you. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Key Soft Skills</h2>


			<p class="txt">According to NACE (2020), the soft skills vital for career readiness are </p>

			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">oral and written communication, </li>

			<li class="li_text">  <a id="p209"></a>professionalism and work ethic, </li>

			<li class="li_text">leadership,</li>

			<li class="li_text">teamwork and collaboration, </li>

			<li class="li_text">digital technology, </li>

			<li class="li_text">career management, </li>

			<li class="li_text">critical thinking and problem solving, and </li>

			<li class="li_text">global and intercultural fluency. </li>
			</ul>


			<p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s take a more in-depth look at these soft skills. </p>


			<h3 class="h3">Oral and Written Communication </h3>

			<p class="txt">Effective communication involves exchanging information, meanings, and feelings; monitoring and modifying language to facilitate understanding; and accurately translating thoughts, feelings, and ideas. It requires active listening and responsive speaking. </p>


			<p class="txt">Successful communication takes into consideration three things: the awareness of the sender, the readiness of the receiver, and the intention of the message. The cardinal rule of interpersonal communication is &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t assume that the person to whom you are speaking understands what you say.&rdquo; If you hear yourself saying, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you may have heard, but that&rsquo;s not what I meant,&rdquo; there has been a communication problem. </p>


			<p class="txt">Effective communication involves articulating your message in a way the recipient can understand. It requires you to focus on conveying your message in the most appropriate manner for the situation. Cultural differences, demographics, language differences, emotional barriers and taboos, physical barriers to nonverbal communication, and differences in perception and viewpoint are some of the many factors that can affect interpersonal communication. When the listener cannot follow the speaker, the listener may misunderstand the message and the other person&rsquo;s intentions. </p>


			
			
      <aside class="aside color-2">
        <h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Communication Skills: Writing in Professional Settings</strong></h4>
        <div class="aside_content">
        
	       
			<p class="txt">Communicating well, especially in writing, is one of the most sought-after skills in almost all career fields. In fact, according to a survey from NACE (2017), 80% of employers ranked written communication as a key attribute they seek in applicants. Good writers are good thinkers and can help others understand complex ideas. When you write in a professional setting, you don&rsquo;t just speak for yourself; you are representing the company for which you work and the reputation that company has built up over the years. When you write effectively as a representative of the company, the client or customer can trust that the company pays attention to details and cares about how it does business. </p>


			<p class="txt">On the other hand, if you were to send out a letter, email, or sales brochure filled with grammatical errors, misspelled words, or even typos, the recipient may legitimately question what other errors the company allows to go out as official documentation. Is manufacturing passing sloppy errors on to the customer? Do they check their math on invoices? Once you give a client a reason to doubt that the company is truly professional, you open the company up for many other suspicions that can be not only embarrassing but also potentially expensive. </p>
<a id="p210"></a>
			<p class="txt">You have a responsibility to both yourself and the company that employs you to be sure you are writing in a way that is more than simply error-free. That level of correctness and accuracy is expected and demanded in a professional setting. Beyond that basic level, your professional writing needs to be effective at conveying your message in the most concise manner possible. You may be offering information, asking for action, or attempting to persuade the reader to agree with you. Regardless of the reason you are writing, provide adequate, accurate information, but do not add more than the recipient needs to know. Lean toward a more formal style by avoiding contractions, slang, excessive underlining and bold fonts, and abbreviations. Even if you conduct business through texts, instant messaging, or email, resist the temptation to include emoticons or cute images. Through your words only, you need to convey a respectful tone that indicates you know the recipients are busy and that you appreciate the time they are taking to read your message.</p>


        </div>
      </aside>


			<br/>


			<h3 class="h3">Professionalism and Work Ethic </h3>
			<p class="txt">Employees who practice professionalism take personal accountability for their work, are punctual, and work productively with others. They also have a strong work ethic and help their organization achieve its goals. The primary components of work ethic include integrity, your sense of responsibility, the quality of your output, and discipline. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Integrity.</strong> People with integrity foster trusting relationships with clients, coworkers, and supervisors. They give honest feedback and exhibit high moral standards. They work hard and do good work because they want to honor the relationships they have with others. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Sense of responsibility.</strong> People with a strong sense of responsibility take ownership of their job performance, show up on time, put in their best effort, and complete projects to the best of their ability. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Emphasis on quality.</strong> People who emphasize quality will work to create the best possible outcome in any task, striving for excellence rather than merely churning out work to meet a deadline. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Discipline.</strong> People with good discipline stay focused and complete assignments (Hill, 2016). </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">Developing a strong work ethic has a lot to do with your conscientiousness and moral values. However, with learning about yourself through reflection and assessment comes insight into what motivates you, engages you, and prompts you to work hard. </p>


			<h3 class="h3">Leadership </h3>
			<p class="txt">At its heart, leadership is the act of guiding and directing others. But if the volume of books and articles on the subject is any indication, <em>good</em> leadership is far more complex and often elusive. No single comprehensive description of leadership exists. What we do know is that leadership requires energizing and motivating others to move forward. Successful leaders help create an inspiring vision of the future. They encourage people to innovate and take reasonable risks, learn from mistakes, and apply new thinking. </p>



<a id="p211"></a>

			<h3 class="h3">Teamwork and Collaboration </h3>

			<p class="txt">In any setting, it is important to be able to work collaboratively as a member of a team&mdash;to work well with others to accomplish a goal. Teams can face a number of different challenges. They may experience a lack of clarity, trust, accountability, time, motivation, and so on (London &amp; Mone, 2016). Some teams are prone to what is known as &ldquo;groupthink.&rdquo; They prioritize harmony and conformity to the point that they discourage disagreement (Janis, 1972, 1982), which can be a real obstacle to reaching creative and effective solutions. Employers want individuals who can bring their talent, motivation, work ethic, and critical thinking skills to collaborative work and thus make the team environment more effective. </p>


			<p class="txt">It is important to note that the purpose of a team is not merely to finish a job but rather to learn with and from each other. Members of any well-functioning team should be able to problem solve together but perform alone. This dynamic serves a dual purpose: First, each team member grows in knowledge and skills by learning from other team members; second, the organization as a whole is strengthened because skills and knowledge are not limited to one person but rather spread across teams. </p>




			<h3 class="h3">Digital Technology </h3>

			<p class="txt">The work world today depends on technology. As a professional team member, you will need to keep up with the rapid changes in technology so you can accomplish the goals of your employer as well as work effectively and efficiently to complete tasks. This adaptability to new and emerging technology may take the form of participating in online courses or workshops to learn new features of familiar software or researching the benefits of an entirely new software or hardware system to improve processes. Continuing to use outdated equipment or inefficient software can be time consuming and costly, so you need to make an effort to stay up-to-date on recent improvements in digital technology. </p>




			<h3 class="h3">Career Management </h3>

			<p class="txt">Even once you have been on the job for some time and feel comfortable and productive in a position, you need to keep tabs on your own skills and knowledge. You may want to apply for a promotion or may be asked to move into a different role, and your consistent attention to your own assets as an employee can help in times of transition. Being able to know what you do well and how to address what you may need help with in a job setting can make you a valuable resource to the company when new opportunities become available or when existing roles need to be restructured. </p>




			<h3 class="h3">Critical Thinking and Problem Solving </h3>

			<p class="txt">Critical thinking is a way people analyze facts to make decisions, and problem solving often requires critical thinking. Unresolved problems can cost companies time and money, so you can see why employers would want workers who are good at these two skills. If you are able to look at a situation and study the surrounding facts by observing, researching, and communicating with others involved, then you would be in a good position to make reasonable and rational suggestions to resolve any problems that might arise. You use critical thinking all the time, such as when you decide which courses you can take to accommodate your work schedule or even when you use previous dining experiences and restaurant reviews to debate where to have dinner with friends on the weekend. </p>

<a id="p212"></a>

			<p class="txt">In a work environment critical thinking typically comes into play when there is a problem to solve. For instance, if your job is to create invoices for products before they are shipped to customers, but your printer stops printing, the shipments can&rsquo;t go to the post office, customers don&rsquo;t get their orders, and production backs up because your area isn&rsquo;t large enough to hold all the incoming orders. This could quickly lead to storage problems, idle workers, and angry customers who want refunds, all of which cost the company time and money. If the problem is simple, like the printer is out of paper, you can refill it and quickly be back in business. But if the problem is more complex, you may have to think critically about the larger situation and simultaneously problem solve to prevent further complications. As you are working on the printer malfunction, you may need to communicate with other departments to divert the finished products to another room in the facility temporarily, designate a colleague to contact customers to anticipate a shipping delay, and reassign production workers to another task until the printer is fixed. If you can manage all this smoothly and quickly, you demonstrate your value as an employee who can think critically and save the company money, time, and its reputation with customers. </p>




			<h3 class="h3">Global and Intercultural Fluency </h3>

			<p class="txt">A soft skill that has become increasingly important in recent years is the ability to work fluently in a global and intercultural environment. The rise of the online marketplace, international business cooperation, and advances in travel and communication all contribute to shrinking the world for business partners and clients. Many careers will find you as easily joining a virtual meeting to confer with your partners around the world as gathering in a physical conference room with only people from one small region. Physical distance no longer dictates how businesses operate, and your ability to respond to this fact by working well with others from different cultures and in different places can make you a strong asset to an employer. Being able to effectively navigate the challenges of language barriers, time zone differences, cultural beliefs, and social values that may change from client to client helps make it so businesses are able to participate successfully in a global and multicultural marketplace. </p>


			<p class="txt">If you can communicate professionally in a language other than English, hone that skill. Learn about the social and business customs of countries and communities with which your company may do business. What is a typical workday or workweek there? Is it considered impolite for a junior member of the staff to address an older colleague without a formal introduction? Is email preferred over texts or vice versa? All these considerations could mean the difference between doing business globally or missing out, so if you can become the go-to person for global and cultural fluency, you have made yourself even more valuable than you are for your hard skills alone, which could translate into promotions, raises, and a stable work situation.</p>




			<h2 class="h2">Specific Skills Necessary for Your Career Path </h2>


			<p class="txt">Beyond obtaining your degree, there will likely be other hard skills necessary for whatever career you decide to pursue. Table 13.2. lists some resources to help you determine which concrete skills are needed for all kinds of professions. You can even discover where you might gain some of the skills and which courses you might take. </p>

	  <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>


		<p class="txt">Thinking about how to become the best professional you can be in your chosen discipline can seem a bit overwhelming at times. You have your coursework to think about and all your other responsibilities in and out of the college setting. Engaging in career planning and professional development can be exciting, too. You are moving that much closer to putting all the knowledge you are gaining from your college courses, labs, and field experiences into your chosen profession, and that can help you see the reasons for all your hard work. </p>


		<p class="txt">Determining what career you want to pursue, or even which ones to explore, is an important decision. Fortunately, your college offers lots of opportunities and support to help guide you, including access to assessments, career services, college-affiliated clubs, and alumni groups. Once you have some ideas about the career path you might want to take, you can try out different options through volunteering, internships, and part-time work. Getting this real-world experience gives you a chance to see what specific skill sets you will need to learn to be successful. You will also have a chance to observe and apply the soft skills employers look for when making hiring decisions. Building up your skill set is key to your career success, and the lifelong learning habits you hone while in college will be key to maintaining and improving your skills over the life of your career. </p>
