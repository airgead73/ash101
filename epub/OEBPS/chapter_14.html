					<p class="txt">Once you have a plan in place for what you want to do after college, the next step is to work on turning that plan into a reality. Working with your various support networks, such as those you identified in your personal development plan, you can put together a realistic strategy to gain more knowledge and experience in the field you chose. If you feel connected to the people and work in this discipline after you have spent time exploring it, you can move toward a career in that field with a formal, professional job search. You can ask around for advice from others in the field and then engage in networking to meet more people who have your same professional interests and who may be seeking strong employees or know of others who are looking to hire. </p>

					<p class="txt">All of this career exploration, experimentation, and networking takes time, so the sooner you can make some basic decisions about the direction in which you want to focus your energy professionally, the better off you&rsquo;ll be. At the very least, it will help you narrow down your options&mdash;are you interested in something health related, or do you want to work with children? Are you looking to advance in a field in which you&rsquo;re currently employed? Making these decisions can help you focus on where and how to spend your time and energy. Although it takes time, all this preliminary work will benefit you as you look to begin or advance your career in a field that interests you. </p>

			</div>

			<div class="section-body">

				<p class="txt">When you are reading, studying, and writing assignments for your classes, you may feel like your education is a solitary pursuit. Despite this individual dedication to your goals, you are not taking this journey by yourself. You have plenty of people who can provide support, offer advice, and encourage you along the way. You can find help from people at your institution as well as in professional organizations, but don&rsquo;t forget your fan base at home and in your personal life. Let your friends and family help you along the way! </p>

				<h2 class="h2">School </h2>

				<p class="txt">When you enter college, you are making a very personal decision to improve your education, and you are responsible for your outcome, but you aren&rsquo;t alone. Your college has an array of student support services to help you navigate your college experience fully and successfully. It&rsquo;s up to you to take advantage of these services, but a good first step is to become aware of all the support you have if and when you need it. Beyond your professors, who are willing to help you with questions about your courses, work with your librarians and advisors to ensure you are on the right track for everything from citing a paper properly to signing up for the correct courses for your major to writing an effective r&eacute;sum&eacute;. If you need monetary assistance to attend college or to limit your need to work while you attend, talk to your financial aid office to see what is available to you in the form of loans, grants, and scholarships. You may be surprised what money is available. Don&rsquo;t let the mandatory paperwork worry you; the counselors in financial aid can help you navigate those preliminary requirements. Typically, colleges offer incoming students an introduction to their student services, but you can always look in your college catalog or on the college&rsquo;s website to find what supports they offer and how to access them. </p>

				<a id="p219"></a>
				<h2 class="h2">Extracurricular Groups </h2>

				<p class="txt">Other supports through school include college-sponsored clubs and organizations. The people you meet through these student programs become part of your college experience. You can learn and practice teamwork, collaboration, cooperation, and leadership by participating in extracurricular groups; employers are looking for just these skills during interviews. You may not have the chance to show a prospective employer how you practiced these important skills in your academic courses, but you can make this case through specific examples of how you collaborated as a member or coordinated events as leader of a college club. </p>

				<p class="txt">Some students feel they just don&rsquo;t have time for anything beyond attending classes, especially if they are also working or attending to other responsibilities. And in some cases this may well be true. However, if you can find a way to participate in any extracurricular groups you can manage, it will be to your benefit. They are that important to your development as both a scholar and a professional. See if any groups affiliated with your chosen discipline have lunchand-learn options where attendees can attend short sessions, either virtually or in person, to listen to a speaker or engage in a discussion about a specific topic. You&rsquo;ll likely need to take a lunch break at some point during the day, so this may be a way for you to participate. Perhaps you can arrange your work schedule to have one free evening a week to coincide with the monthly meetings of a professional networking group. You can use the free evening the other weeks to get in some extra study time or to attend to other important responsibilities. You can also see if there are any groups holding online sessions where you could engage with others in discussion posts or other online communications. If you can&rsquo;t find any, perhaps you could get a few students together from some of your classes to set one up; this could be a great opportunity to showcase your leadership and initiative skills to future employers! It is up to you to take control of your limited time and prioritize it for things that are important to you. You can&rsquo;t join all the clubs your college offers, nor would it be reasonable to do so, but getting involved in one or two clubs can pay dividends down the road as you enrich your learning experience and build connections with other like-minded people. </p>

						<p class="caption">Including your children in your learning process is one way to encourage support for your learning at home.</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h2 class="h2">Home </h2>

				<p class="txt">You may be the only person in your home who is attending college, or you may be one of many. Either way, the people at home can be a strong support network for you. If you can establish some cooperative arrangements with family members to help you with some of your at-home responsibilities, this could free up more time for you to study or work on school assignments and projects. If you have young children, you may already recognize how important your home support system is to allowing you to focus on your education while knowing your kids are in safe hands. </p>

				<a id="p220"></a>
				<p class="txt">Child care isn&rsquo;t the only way your at-home support network can help you with your college success. If you need quiet time in the mornings to read or study, perhaps you can ask others at home to support you by establishing and respecting specific &ldquo;quiet hours.&rdquo; One way to maintain strong interest in your college experience with your at-home supporters is to include them in the exciting aspects of the process that they may not know about. Tell them about what you&rsquo;re learning and what your plan is after you graduate. If your college has public events, such as orientation or guest speakers, take your family members so they can be a part of your experience and see how important college is to you. And of course, invite them to celebrate with you at graduation! Family members and close friends can be some of your greatest allies and support you when you need it most. Keep in mind that you are not alone in reaching your academic and professional goals. Help is available in many forms; all you need to do is ask. </p>

			</div>   

			<div class="section-body">

				<p class="txt">As mentioned in earlier chapters, your career will likely not be a straight and narrow path. Career experts have estimated that the average person will change careers 5 to 7 times and jobs 11 times in a lifetime (Gleason, 2009; Young, 2017). To best prepare yourself for whatever path your career takes, be sure to set goals and assess your interests, skills, and values often, and seek opportunities for career growth and enrichment. Taking advantage of the rich set of resources available to you, whether through your college or beyond, will help you explore your options and seize those opportunities for career and professional growth. </p>

						<p class="caption">Resources provided by your school&#39;s career services office may include access to alumni and networking events, which are great opportunities to learn more about your career options.</p>
					</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<h2 class="h2">School Resources </h2>

				<p class="txt">Whether you are a student, a graduate, or even an employee, you can obtain invaluable career-development assistance at your college or university. Your college&rsquo;s career services team can support, guide, and empower you in every step of the career-development process, from initial planning to achieving lifelong career satisfaction. The career services team offers resources to help you decide what careers may be the best fit for your personality and talents; additionally, the team or office can help with a job search strategy once you&rsquo;ve completed adequate career exploration&mdash;this assistance can include networking help, mock interviews and interviewing strategy, r&eacute;sum&eacute; assessment and assistance, and one-on-one career advising for entry-level to executive-level candidates. Using all the resources at your disposal is something you should always be doing, but especially when it comes to planning for your career. Even after you have a great job, you can still use the career-development services available to you to increase your eligibility for promotions or raises or to help you keep up with changes in your field. Continuing to learn even after your formal education is over is a way of life for most professionals. </p>

				<a id="p221"></a>
				<p class="txt">Your college is also likely to have another important resource that can offer support and help you develop your career: alumni associations. College alumni often maintain a relationship with the school and with their fellow graduates. Just by attending the same college, you have something in common with them. You chose the same place, maybe for similar reasons, and you might be having similar experiences. Often, alumni are eager to help current students by offering their professional insights and making career connections. You can find out about alumni events on your school&rsquo;s website or from Career and Alumni Services. These events can be fun and beneficial to attend, especially those involving networking opportunities. Note that specific departments or school-affiliated organizations may have their own alumni groups, whether formal or informal. Try to find former students who majored in your field or who have a job similar to the one you&rsquo;d like one day. Remember, members of alumni organizations make a choice to be involved; they want to be there. It&rsquo;s very likely they&rsquo;ll be interested in offering you some help, mentoring, or even introductions to the right people. </p>

				<h2 class="h2">Books on Career Development </h2>

				<p class="txt">Although going to college is one of the best steps you can take to prepare for a career, soon-to-be or recently graduated students are not necessarily guaranteed jobs. Staying educated about strategies for developing your career and finding new jobs will help you manage ongoing transitions. Books like Larry Chiagouris&rsquo;s <em>The Secret to Getting a Job After College: Marketing Tactics to Turn Degrees Into Dollars</em> are written specifically to help recent graduates increase their chances of finding a job right after college. Chiagouris&rsquo;s book speaks to students in all majors and provides tips and tactics to attract the attention of an employer and successfully compete with other candidates to get the job you want. Another useful job search book is Steve Dalton&rsquo;s <em>The 2-Hour Job Search: Using Technology to Get the Right Job Faster</em>. As the title suggests, Dalton&rsquo;s book covers how to use the latest technology to your advantage as you search for a job. </p>

				<p class="txt">There are also books that go into more specific topics, such as Daniel Goleman&rsquo;s <em>Emotional Intelligence: Why It Can Matter More Than IQ</em>; emotional intelligence, being aware of both your own and others&rsquo; emotions, is widely considered a desirable trait employers look for when hiring (Smith, 2020). Whatever your career interests, there is no shortage of books on career and skill development that can help you learn and grow. </p>

				<h2 class="h2">Plan-Do-Check-Act </h2>

				<p class="txt">Plan-do-check-act (PDCA) is a deliberate strategy you can use to evaluate where you are in the career-development process and to identify your next steps. The strategy is typically used in the business arena as a framework for improving processes and services, but you can think of your career as a personal product you are offering or selling. This step strategy includes the following four steps. </p>

				<ol class="nl">
					<li class="li_text"><strong>Plan.</strong> What are your goals and objectives? What process will you use to get to your targets? You might want to plan smaller to begin with and test out possible effects. For instance, if you are thinking of getting into a certain career, you might plan to try it out first as an intern or volunteer or on a part-time basis. When you start on a small scale, you can test possible outcomes. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Do.</strong> Implement your plan. Sell your product&mdash;which is you and your skills, talents, energy, and enthusiasm. Collect data as you go along; you will need it for charting and analyzing in the check and act steps ahead. Data for your career development may include salary, benefits, location, opportunities for advancement, and your overall satisfaction. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><a id="p222"></a><strong>Check.</strong> Look at your results so far. Are you happy with your job or wherever you are in the career-development process? How are your actual accomplishments measuring up next to your intentions and wishes? Look for where you may have deviated in your intended steps. For example, did you take a job in another city when your initial plan was to work closer to friends and family? What are the pros and cons? If you like, create a chart that shows you all the factors. With a chart, it will be easier to see trends over several PDCA cycles. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Act.</strong> How should you act going forward? What changes in planning, doing, and checking do you want to take? </li>
				</ol>

				<p class="txt">The PDCA framework is an ongoing process. Keep planning, doing, checking, and acting. The goal is continuous improvement! </p>

				<h1 class="h1"><span class="sec_number">14.3</span> <span class="sec_title">Strategies for Professional Networking</span></h1>
			</div>

			<div class="section-body">

				<p class="txt">In the context of career development, networking is the process by which people build relationships with one another for the purpose of helping each another achieve professional goals. Networking is such a critical part of professional life that nearly every city or region has organizations and events devoted to it. Meetups are occasions for people with shared interests, skills, and professions to gather together and talk about their experiences and insights. The events might involve a brief talk or demonstration, a discussion or question-and-answer period, and then plenty of time for mingling. You can likely find these events with a quick online search. Before you go to a meetup, carefully review the guidelines and limits on who can attend. Some meetups may not be open to students or others not formally employed in a specific field. Don&rsquo;t be offended by these barriers&mdash;the meetup organizers have specific goals and members to consider&mdash;but if you find one you can attend, try it out. </p>

				<p class="txt">When you network, you may engage in many of the following strategies: </p>

				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text">discussing industry trends, resources, or developments with other professionals in your industry&mdash;this could be on social media like LinkedIn, in the college classroom, via email, or at in-person networking events </li>
					<li class="li_text">sharing business cards, r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, cover letters, job-seeking strategies, leads about open jobs, information about companies and organizations, and information about a specific field</li>
					<li class="li_text">sharing information about meetup groups, conferences, special events, technology tools, and social media </li>
					<li class="li_text">soliciting job &ldquo;headhunters,&rdquo; career counselors, career centers, career coaches, an alumni association, family members, friends, acquaintances, and vendors </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">Networking can occur anywhere and at any time. In fact, your network expands with each new relationship you establish. And the networking strategies you can employ are nearly limitless. With imagination and ingenuity, your networking can be highly successful. </p>

				<a id="p223"></a>
				<h2 class="h2">How to Get Started </h2>

				<p class="txt">We live in a social world. Almost everywhere you go and anything you do professionally involves connecting with people. It stands to reason that finding a new job and advancing your career entails building relationships with these people. In fact, research has shown that the majority of jobs are never even posted, and up to 85% of all jobs are filled through networking (Adler, 2016). This research gives statistical significance to the importance of &ldquo;who you know.&rdquo; Of course, you must have the qualifications as well, but people are more comfortable hiring people they know in some way than taking a risk on a total unknown. Truly, the most effective way to find a new job is to network, network, and network some more. </p>

				<p class="txt">Once you acknowledge the value of networking, the challenge is figuring out how to do it. What is your first step? Whom do you contact? What do you say? How long will it take? Where do you concentrate efforts? How do you know if your investments will pay off? </p>

				<p class="txt">For every question you may ask, a range of strategies can be used. Consultant and professional networker Hank Blank (2012) recommends the following modern and no-nonsense strategies. </p>

				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text">Master Linkedin because that is what human resource departments use.<br/>Post updates.</li>
					<li class="li_text">Hope is not a plan. You need a plan of action to achieve your networking goals. </li>
					<li class="li_text">Keenly focus your activities on getting a job. Use all tools available to you. </li>
					<li class="li_text">You need business cards. No ifs, ands, or buts. </li>
					<li class="li_text">Register your own domain name. Find your favorite geek to build you a landing page. Keep building your site for the rest of your life. </li>
					<li class="li_text">Attend networking events. Most of them offer student rates. </li>
					<li class="li_text">Think of your colleagues and friends as databases. Leverage their knowledge and their willingness to help you. </li>
					<li class="li_text">Create the world in which you want to live in the future by fostering it today through your networking activity. These are the times to live in a world of &ldquo;this is how I can help.&rdquo; </li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="h2">Networking Strategies at College </h2>

				<p class="txt">Though some of these strategies have been mentioned throughout this text, they bear repeating in the context of building your professional network. The following are some of the most important things you can do to build your network while in college. </p>

				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text"><strong>Get to know your professors.</strong> Communicating with instructors is a valuable way to learn about a career and also to get letters of reference if and when needed for a job. Professors can also give you leads on job openings, internships, and research possibilities. Many of your college faculty likely have (or had) other roles and positions. For example, accounting faculty, especially certified public accountants, might take on tax work every spring. Learn from them what the job is like and how you can better prepare for it. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Connect with alumni on LinkedIn.</strong> Once you&rsquo;ve built your LinkedIn profile, search for your college&rsquo;s page in the search bar and click &ldquo;Alumni&rdquo; in the menu. This will provide a database of LinkedIn users who are alumni of your college. Connect with as many people as you can! </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Check with classmates.</strong> Classmates may or may not share your major, but any of them may have leads that could help you. You could be just one conversation away from a good lead. </li>
				</ul>

				<a id="p224"></a>
				<h2 class="h2">Networking Strategies at Work </h2>

				<p class="txt">Even if you have already begun your career prior to or during your time in college, you should still be actively growing and maintaining your professional network. The following are ways you can stay on top of and broaden your network, both as a student and as an already employed professional. </p>

				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text"><strong>Join professional organizations.</strong> You can meet many influential people at local and national meetings and events of professional and volunteer organizations. Learn about these organizations. See if they have membership discounts for students or have student chapters. Once you are a member, you may have access to membership lists, which can give you prospective access to many new people with whom you can network. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Volunteer.</strong> Volunteering is an excellent way to meet new people who can help you develop your career, even if the organization you are volunteering with is not in your field. Just by working alongside others and working toward common goals, you build relationships that may later serve you in unforeseen and helpful ways. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Get an internship.</strong> Many organizations offer internship positions to college students. Some of these positions are paid, but often they are not. Paid or not, you gain experience relevant to your career, and you potentially make many new contacts. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Get a part-time job.</strong> If you are not already working, you may want to consider working a part-time job. Invariably, you will meet people who can help with your networking goals. You can also gain good experience along the way, which you can add to your r&eacute;sum&eacute;. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Join a job club.</strong> Your career interests may be shared by many others who have organized a club, which can be online or in person. If you don&rsquo;t find an existing club, consider starting one.</li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Attend networking events.</strong> There are innumerable professional networking events taking place around the world and also online. Find them listed in magazines, community calendars, newspapers, journals, and the websites of companies, organizations, and associations.</li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Conduct informational interviews.</strong> You may initiate contact with people in your chosen field who can tell you about their experiences of entering the field and thriving in it. Many websites have guidance on how to plan and conduct these interviews. </li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="h2">Networking Strategies at Home and Beyond </h2>

				<p class="txt">Though it may not seem obvious, people outside your immediate academic and professional circles can also be a great resource for professional networking! The key is to get creative about the possible connections that might exist in a broader environment. </p>

				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text"><strong>Participate in online social media.</strong> Social media sites, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Pinterest, harbor a vast amount of career opportunity. Although social media tends to favor a more informal tone, when using it in this capacity, it will be important to keep your communication professional. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Read articles and posts from other professionals.</strong> Peruse professional forums and blogs for articles and posts relevant to your field; if one catches your interest and it contains names of professionals, you can reach out to them to learn more and get job leads. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><a id="p225"></a><strong>Ask family members, friends, and acquaintances for referrals.</strong> Do they know others who might help you? You can start with the question &ldquo;Who else should I be talking to?&rdquo; </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Use business cards or networking cards.</strong> A printed business card can be an essential tool to help your contacts remember you. Creativity can help in this regard, too. While there are a number of printing and design services available online, you can also design your own cards and either hand print them or print them on a home printer. Just be sure to provide accurate contact information and proofread for any errors. </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">The bottom line with developing professional networks is to cull information from as many sources as possible and use that information in creative ways to advance your career opportunities. </p>

				<aside class="aside color-2">
					<h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Tech Tips:</strong> How to Build an Effective LinkedIn Profile</h4>
					<div class="aside_content">

						<p class="txt">LinkedIn is an online social media platform focused on professional networking. It is a useful tool for those seeking employment opportunities and for organizations seeking to hire, and it can even be an effective way to receive notifications about jobs based on your geographic location and skills listed in your profile. It is up to the individual to create an attention-grabbing profile, make &ldquo;connections&rdquo; (like &ldquo;friending&rdquo; on other platforms), and build professional relationships through engagement in newsfeed posting and direct messaging. LinkedIn profiles are public to others using the platform, so it is important to build a profile that is appropriate for and attractive to potential employers. </p>

						<p class="txt">A well-constructed LinkedIn profile has a better chance of appearing in employers&rsquo; keyword searches and attracting professional connections. The following tips will help you build an effective profile. </p>

						<ul class="bl">

				<p class="txt">You may or may not have thought much about planning for your future career before you entered college. But now that you are in college, you should take some time to reflect on your career goals seriously and to establish a realistic plan to reach those goals. Fortunately, you aren&rsquo;t alone in moving from college to the workforce, so learn as much as you can about the resources and support networks around you. Your college will already have many student support services in place to guide you, and you can learn a great deal about different career fields from professionals in your community and even within your own family. </p>

				<p class="txt">Read as much as you can in articles, books, and online sites to determine what would be the best fit for you and your personality. Then make plans to get out and introduce yourself. This may be difficult sometimes, but do your research, know what you want, and go out and meet people who have either specific career knowledge that will help you or actual job opportunities you may be able to explore. Not every networking event or volunteer project is going to produce a job offer, and you shouldn&rsquo;t look at it that way. Instead, approach these as opportunities to connect with other like-minded participants who may be able to share information about industry expectations, licensing requirements, and possible job leads. After setting up your contacts through these events, you&rsquo;ll begin to understand the career field better and see how you fit in. Don&rsquo;t worry if you realize that what you thought was a good fit doesn&rsquo;t feel so great after you&rsquo;ve done some research or work in the field. Talk to others and see if they know of a related career avenue you can explore. Important decisions like your professional career have many elements for you to consider, so you won&rsquo;t find an easy answer. Rather, the goal is to find the best answer for you. </p>
