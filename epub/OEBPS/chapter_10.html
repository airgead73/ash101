Perhaps you&rsquo;ve experienced hurdles with your health, setbacks to financial goals, or relationship or emotional challenges. What did you do when you faced these difficulties? How did you press on toward your goals despite those challenges? Did you reset your thinking, attempt a different way of tackling the task, or perhaps seek help or support?</p>


		<p class="txt">This chapter explores the concepts of grit and resilience, or the internal strength to persevere and overcome failure, as well as the mindset required to believe in your ability to meet your goals. Research summarized in this chapter demonstrates that the most successful students are those who set goals that are aligned with their values and persist in pursuing those goals, even if they must overcome failure along the way. As you learn about these concepts, recall experiences you have had in other areas of your life when you&rsquo;ve drawn on your strength to press forward. You&rsquo;ve proved you can do it! This chapter asks you to extend this same strength and resilience to your academic goals. </p>

			<p class="txt">In this section, we will discuss particular traits that may at first seem unrelated to learning. Some people would consider them more like components of a personal outlook than a learning practice, and yet they have significant influence on your ability to learn. What we are talking about here are resilience and grit. <strong>Resilience</strong> refers to your mindset with regard to obstacles and your ability to quickly overcome challenges. Consider, for example, how you might react to getting a bad grade on an assignment. Some students may feel discouraged and consider giving up on the course or on their academic goals. Alternatively, you display resilience when, despite being disappointed, you can quickly assess what you need to do to improve and set about making those improvements so you can move forward toward your goal. </p>

			<p class="txt">Resilience is a key component of grit. <strong>Grit</strong> can be defined as sustained personal perseverance toward a task or goal, even when challenges arise. In learning, it can be thought of as a trait that drives a person to keep trying until they succeed. It is not tied to talent or ability but is simply a tendency not to give up until something is finished or accomplished. This personality trait was defined as &ldquo;grit&rdquo; by psychologist Angela Duckworth. In a 2007 study, Duckworth and colleagues found that individuals with a high level of grit were able to maintain motivation in learning tasks despite failures. The study examined a cross section of learning environments, such as GPA scores in Ivy League universities, dropout rates at West Point, rankings in the National Spelling Bee, and general educational attainment for adults. What the results showed was that grit and perseverance were better predictors of academic success and achievement than talent or IQ. </p>

			<aside class="aside color-2">
			  <h4 class="aside_title">Try It: How Gritty Are You?</h4>
                  <div class="aside_content">
					<p class="txt">Take the Grit Scale survey developed by Angela Duckworth to determine your level of grit: </p>

					<p class="ext"><a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/">https://angeladuckworth.com/grit-scale/</a></p>

					<p class="txt">Was your grit score higher or lower than you expected? Were you surprised by this result? How did your score compare to those of other American adults? </p>

					<p class="txt">Take a moment to consider when, in another aspect of your life other than academics, you may have demonstrated grit. The same strength, resilience, and determination that pushed you in that situation can be transferred to your academic efforts as well. Say to yourself something like &ldquo;If I can do or overcome <em>that</em>, then I can definitely do or overcome <em>this</em>.&rdquo; </p>

					<p class="txt">No matter where you currently fall on the Grit Scale, remember that grit is something you work at actively! </p>
				  </div>
            </aside>
				
			<h2 class="h2">Applying Grit </h2>

			<p class="txt">The concept of grit is an easy one to take for granted. In our culture, we have a number of sayings and aphorisms that capture the essence of grit: &ldquo;If at first you do not succeed, try, try again,&rdquo; or the famous quote attributed to Thomas Edison: &ldquo;Genius is one percent inspiration, ninety-nine percent perspiration.&rdquo; The problem is that, although we may <em>understand</em> the concept, actually <em>applying</em> it takes work. And if the task we are trying to complete is a difficult one, it can take a lot of work. </p>

			<p class="txt">The first step in applying grit is to adopt an attitude that achieving the end goal is the only acceptable outcome. With this attitude comes an acceptance that you may not succeed on the first attempt&mdash;or the 19th attempt. Failed attempts are viewed as merely part of the process and seen as a very useful way to gain knowledge that moves you toward success. An example of this would be studying for an exam. In your first attempt at studying, you simply reread the chapters of your textbook covered in the exam. You find that while this reinforces some of the knowledge you have gained, it does not ensure you have all the information you will need to do well on the test. You know that if you simply read the chapters yet again, there is no guarantee you are going to be any more successful. You determine that you need to find a different approach. In other words, your first attempt was not a complete failure, but it did not achieve the end goal, so you try again using a different method. </p>

			<p class="txt">On your second try, you copy down all of the main points onto a piece of paper using the section headlines from the chapters. After a short break, you come back to your list and write down a summary of what you know about each item on your list. This accomplishes two things: first, you are able to immediately spot areas where you need to learn more, and second, you can check your summaries against the text to make certain what you know is correct and adequate. In this example, while you may not yet have achieved complete success, you will have learned what you need to do next. </p>
			
			<a id="p160"></a>
			<p class="txt">In true grit fashion, for your next try, you study those items on your list where you found youneeded a bit more information, and then you go through your list again. This time you areable to write down summaries of all the important points, and you are confident you havethe knowledge you need to do well on the exam. After this, you still do not stop, but insteadyou change your approach to use other methods that keep what you have learned fresh inyour mind. </p>

			<h2 class="h2">Keeping Grit in Mind: Grit to GRIT </h2>

			<p class="txt">While encouraging grit became very popular in education circles as a way to help students become more successful, the concept of grit as a personality trait was originally recognized as something positive in all areas of activity. Using a grit approach and working until the goal is achieved has been found to be very effective not only in academics but in many other  areas (Agrawal &amp; Luqman, 2019; Neisser et al., 1996; Vainio &amp; Daukantait&#279;, 2016; Weisskirch,  2019). In fact, many of those who were first introduced to grit through education have begun applying it to business, professional development, and their personal lives. </p>

			<p class="txt"><em>New York Times</em> best-selling author Paul G. Stoltz (2014) has taken grit and turned it into the acronym GRIT (growth, resilience, instinct, and tenacity) to help people remember and use the attributes of a grit mindset. Each of these elements is explained in Table 10.1. </p>

			<section class="table_container">
				<h4 class="tbl_name">
				  <span class="tbl_number">Table 10.1:</span><br />
				  <span class="tbl_title">GRIT explained</span>
				</h4>
				<table class="tbl">
					  
				   <tbody>

					<tr>
					<td>Growth</td>
					<td>Your propensity to seek and consider new ideas, additional alternatives, different approaches, and fresh perspectives</td>
					</tr>

					</tr>
					
					</tbody>
				</table>
			</section>

			<p class="txt">Note that setting the right goals is as important to GRIT as is seeing them through. There is also one other thing to keep in mind when it comes to applying grit (or GRIT) to college success: The same sort of persevering approach not only can be used for individual learning activities but can be applied to your entire degree. An attitude of tenacity and &ldquo;sticking with it&rdquo; until you reach the desired results works just as well for graduation as it does for studying for an exam. </p>

			<h2 class="h2">How Do You Get Grit? </h2>

			<p class="txt">A quick Internet search will reveal that there are a large number of articles out there on grit and how to get it. While these sources may vary in their lists, most cover about five basic ideas that all touch on concepts emphasized by Duckworth et al. (2007). What follows is a brief introduction to each. Note that each idea begins with a verb. In other words, it is an activity for you to <em>do</em> and <em>keep doing</em> in order to build grit. </p>
			
			<ol class="nl">
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Pursue what interests you.</strong> Personal interest is a great motivator! People tend to have more grit when pursuing things that they have developed an interest in. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><a id="p161"></a><strong>Practice until you can do it, and then keep practicing.</strong> The idea of practicing has been applied to every skill in human experience. The reason everyone seems to be so fixated on practice is that it is effective and there is no &ldquo;grittier&rdquo; activity. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Find purpose in what you do.</strong> Purpose is truly the driver for anything we pursue. If you have a strong purpose in any activity, you have reason to persist at it. Think in terms of end goals and why doing something is worth it. Purpose answers the question &ldquo;Why should I accomplish this?&rdquo; </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Have hope in what you are doing.</strong> Have hope in what you are doing and in how it will make things different for you or others. While this is somewhat related to purpose, it should be viewed as a separate and positive overall outlook in regard to what you are trying to achieve. Hope gives value to purpose. If purpose is the goal, hope is why the goal is worth attaining. </li>

			<li class="li_text"><strong>Surround yourself with gritty people.</strong> Persistence and tenacity tend to rub off onothers, as do their opposites. As social creatures, we often adopt the behaviors of thepeople we hang out with. If you are surrounded by people who quit before achievingtheir goals, you may find it acceptable to give up early as well. On the other hand, ifyour peers are all achievers with grit, you will tend to exhibit grit yourself. </li>		
			</ol>

			<p class="txt">Another item to add to this list expands on the idea of surrounding yourself with gritty people: Get yourself a grit partner. It is an unfortunate fact that far too many students who begin college never complete their degree (Shapiro et al., 2019). Over the years a tremendous amount of research has gone into why some students complete college while others do not. In its research, American College Testing (ACT; King &amp; Ndum, 2017) found something very significant in response to this question. </p>

			<p class="txt">ACT is a nonprofit organization that administers the college admissions test by the same name, and it has studied over 50 years of student persistence data. What the organization found is that the probability a student will stay in college is tied directly to social connections. In other words, students who found someone they connected with and who provided them a sense of accountability dramatically increased their grit. It did not matter if the person was another student, an instructor, or someone else. What did matter is that the students felt a strong motivation to keep working, even when their college experience was at its most difficult. It has been surmised that from a psychological perspective, the extra grit comes from not wanting to disappoint the person they have connected with. Regardless of the reason, the data show that having a grit partner is one of the most effective ways to statistically increase your chances of graduation. </p>
			
			<aside class="aside color-2">
			  <h4 class="aside_title">Try It: Get a Grit Partner</h4>
                  <div class="aside_content">
				  <p class="txt">A grit partner does not have to be a formal relationship. Your partner can simply be a classmate&mdash;someone you can talk with. It can be an instructor you admire or someone else you establish a connection with. It can even be a family member who will encourage you&mdash;someone you do not want to disappoint. What you are looking for is someone who will help motivate you, either by their example or by their willingness to give you a pep talk when you need it. The key is that it is someone you respect and who will encourage you to do well in school. </p>
				  
				  <a id="p162"></a>
				  <p class="txt">Right now, think of a few people who could be your grit partner. Record their names and the qualities that make them good potential grit partners (you can use a format like the one shown in Figure 10.1 for this exercise). Keep in mind that you may not have the same grit partner throughout your entire college experience. You may begin with a classmate but later find that your favorite instructor motivates you more to do well in school than anyone else. Regardless, the important thing is to find that social connection that helps your grit. </p>

		<p class="txt">Growing up, many of us heard a parent, adult, or teacher say, &ldquo;If you think you can succeed, you will succeed. Try, try again!&rdquo; While this saying was often used to serve as a motivator, there is research supporting the idea of a growth mindset that views failure as a momentary setback and opportunity to grow. Dr. Carol Dweck, a renowned education researcher, coined the terms <em>fixed mindset</em> and <em>growth mindset</em> to describe the beliefs people have about learning and intelligence (Dweck, 2006; Dweck et al., 2011). </p>

		<p class="txt">Individuals who adopt a <strong>fixed mindset</strong> believe that they are either smart or dumb and that there is little opportunity to grow or change their abilities or talents (Morehead, 2012). Students who hold a fixed mindset generally fear appearing unintelligent and are often less motivated, more likely to engage in task avoidance, and more likely to exhibit behaviors that do not lead to success in school (Farrington et al., 2012; Morehead, 2012). Meanwhile, individuals with a <strong>growth mindset</strong> believe that their talents and abilities can be improved with effort; thus, they are focused on learning and using hard work and feedback as a means to improve (Morehead, 2012). This in turn can lead to increased effort and motivation to drive success in school. Figure 10.2 compares the two mindsets. </p>

		<p class="txt">Something you may have noticed is that a growth mindset would tend to give a learner grit and persistence. If you had learning as your major goal, you would normally keep trying to attain that goal even if it took you multiple attempts. Not only that, but if you learned a little bit more with each try, you would see each attempt as a success, even if you had not achieved complete mastery of whatever it was you were working to learn. With that in mind, it should come as no surprise that Dweck (2006) found that those people who believed their abilities could change through learning (growth vs. a fixed mindset) readily accepted learning challenges and persisted despite early failures. </p>

		<a id="p164"></a>
		<p class="txt">As strange as it may seem, research into fixed vs. growth mindsets has also shown that if you believe you can learn something new, you greatly improve your ability to learn. At first, this may seem like the sort of feel-good advice we often encounter in social media posts or quotes that are intended to inspire or motivate us, but in looking at the differences outlined between a fixed and a growth mindset, you can see how each part of the growth mindset path can increase your probability of success when it comes to learning. </p>


		<aside class="aside color-2">
			  <h4 class="aside_title">Try It: Fixed vs. Growth Mindset</h4>
                  <div class="aside_content">
				  <p class="txt">Very few people have a strict fixed or growth mindset all of the time. Often, we tend to lean one way or another in certain situations. For example, a person trying to improve their ability in a sport they enjoy may exhibit all of the growth mindset traits and characteristics, but they find themselves blocked in a fixed mindset when they try to learn something in another area like computer programming or math. </p>

				  <p class="txt">In this exercise, do a little self-analysis and think of some areas where you may find yourself hindered by a fixed mindset. Using the outline presented in Figure 10.3, write down ideas for how you can change your own behavior for each part of the learning process. What will you do to move from a fixed to a growth mindset? For example, say you were trying to learn to play a musical instrument. In the &ldquo;Challenges&rdquo; row in Figure 10.3, you might pursue a growth mindset by trying to play increasingly more difficult songs rather than sticking to the easy ones you have already mastered. In the &ldquo;Criticism&rdquo; row, you might take someone&rsquo;s comment about a weakness in timing as a motivation for you to practice with a metronome. For &ldquo;Success of others,&rdquo; you could take inspiration from a famous musician who is considered a master and study their techniques. </p>

				  <p class="txt">Whatever it is that you decide you want to use for your analysis, apply each of the &ldquo;Growth characteristics&rdquo; in Figure 10.3 to determine a course of action to improve. </p>

            <h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Tech Tips:</strong> Tools for Nurturing Grit and a Growth Mindset</h4>
            <div class="aside_content">
				<p class="txt">When looking for tools to nurture grit or help reset your mindset, you will likely find many apps related to athletics. Believing in yourself and pushing yourself past your comfort zone to achieve is often associated with athletes and the fitness community. While these apps can be useful when applied to learning, a more apt search term when looking for your own apps is &ldquo;motivation.&rdquo; Recall that both grit and growth mindset are very much related to fostering and maintaining motivation. Motivational apps help keep your mind focused on positive thoughts and provide you support and regular reminders of your strength and capability. Motivational apps vary but mostly focus on intrinsic motivational factors, so you may find apps that provide daily motivational quotes, success visualization exercises, gratitude journals, secular and nonsecular affirmations, journaling tools, and motivational videos. Each individual is uniquely motivated, so you may find that apps that work for others are not as useful for you, or vice versa. Three popular related apps include the following. </p>

				<ul class="bl">
					<li class="li_text">Happiness Wizard (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://happiness-wizard.com">https://happiness-wizard.com</a>) is a goal- and habit-tracking app focused on supporting emotional wellness and positive mood through self-reflective exercises and journaling. Happiness Wizard seeks to inspire with motivational quotes and acts as a repository of ideas where you can note your goals as you think of them to revisit as you&rsquo;re working toward them. Happiness Wizard also provides a daily happiness score that you can track across time to see if it may be necessary to reset your focus. </li>

					<li class="li_text">Productive&mdash;Habit Tracker (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://productiveapp.io">https://productiveapp.io</a>) is an iOS-specific app thatallows you to set personal goals; track progress; motivate yourself with daily, weekly, and monthly progress analysis; and receive task notifications and reminders. Both the Happiness Wizard and Productive&mdash;Habit Tracker apps are based on the idea that as you <em>see</em> the progress of your successes, your belief in yourself (self-efficacy) will grow, and you will be increasingly motivated to persist to the completion of your goals. </li>

					<li class="li_text">Another popular app, Flow Lab (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https:/flowlab.com/en/">https:/flowlab.com/en/</a>), is more geared to fostering a growth mindset. It includes guided meditations and audio coaching sessions that help maintain optimism and focus on personal strengths. Flow Lab is also designed to help you remain calm and confident even as you face challenges. </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">In addition to these recommended apps, there are free online courses that you can access to gain an even deeper understanding of the concepts of grit and growth mindset as you apply them in your life. Such courses are offered by Coursera (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.coursera.org/lecture/emerging-technologies-lifelong-learning/growth-vs-fixed-mindset-YulSB">https://www.coursera.org/lecture/emerging-technologies-lifelong-learning/growth-vs-fixed-mindset-YulSB</a>); Udemy (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/growthmindset/">https://www.udemy.com/course/growthmindset/</a>); and iTunes (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/grow-your-mindset-a-course-in-growth-mindset/id1142282195">https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/grow-your-mindset-a-course-in-growth-mindset/id1142282195</a>). </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>

	  <p class="txt">This chapter addressed the habits of thinking that are most closely aligned with achieving success. Grit is the perseverance required to persist through challenges to achieve a goal and plays an important role in students&rsquo; capacity to learn and to complete their degrees. Strategies to adopt and apply grit include pursuing what interests you, practicing, finding purpose and having hope in what you are doing, and surrounding yourself with others who have and encourage you to have grit. Establishing a grit partner can help provide perspective and an additional push when you lose sight of your goals. </p>

	  <a id="p166"></a>
	  <p class="txt">Like grit, a growth mindset is associated with a student&rsquo;s ability to succeed. If you believe that you are capable of doing something but just can&rsquo;t do that thing yet, then it is worthwhile to create a plan of action and to persist.  </p>

	  <p class="txt">There are many factors that can impact your success as a student. Some of these factors&mdash;like balancing additional responsibilities, navigating challenging teaching styles, or managing financial strains while attending school&mdash;may be beyond your control. However, it should be comforting to note that two of the most researched factors that impact student success&mdash;grit and mindset&mdash;are very much within your control. Using the tips and practice exercises shared in this chapter, you can work toward adopting these habits of thinking to overcome challenges and meet your goals! </p>
