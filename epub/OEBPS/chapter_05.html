                    <p class="txt">
                        &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said the centipede. &ldquo;Let me see . . . First, I. . . .&rdquo; But words soon failed her. She could not for the life of her remember which leg went first, which second, where, how . . . so she tried to figure it out, attempting various combinations of movements. First the front right leg, then the . . . no, not that one, the second on the right . . . oops. . . . And the poor thing wound up tying herself into a huge knot.

                    <p class="txt">
                        The point is that the centipede&rsquo;s learning to walk happens unconsciously. It is not an intentional, conscious process requiring focused attention or deliberate memorization. As this chapter makes clear, we, like the centipede, also learn many things unconsciously. But we also learn a great deal consciously, because of effort and focus. And our learning can be greatly enhanced by applying strategies and approaches that are most appropriate for the specific learning tasks we face, given our individual preferences, abilities, and previous learning.

                        This chapter describes various kinds of learning that psychology has identified and different approaches that might be used for learning (different <em>learning styles</em>). It looks as wellat the role the brain plays in learning. Brain-based education is an approach that seeksto apply what science knows about the brain to learning and education. There are surelyimportant implications here for all learners, whether in their first year or nearing completion of their degree.

                    The first, fundamental point to understand about learning is that there are several types oflearning. Different kinds of knowledge are learned in different ways. Each of these differenttypes of learning can require different processes that may take place in different parts ofour brain.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    For example, simple memorization is a form of learning that does not always require deep understanding. Children often learn this way when they memorize poems or verses. An interesting example of this can be found in the music industry, where there have been several hit songs sung in English by vocalists who do not speak English. In these cases, the singers did not understand what they were singing but instead simply memorized the sounds of the words in the proper order. Memorizing sounds is a vastly different type of learning than, say, acquiring a deep understanding of Einstein&rsquo;s general theory of relativity.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Remembering and understanding are just two of the different kinds of learning psychologists have identified. Benjamin Bloom describes six distinct categories of learning that can be distinguished in terms of the activities associated with each. In addition to remembering and understanding, Bloom also identified applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating (Anderson &amp; Krathwohl, 2001).

                    In Table 5.1 the cells in the left column each contain one of the six main levels of learning, categorized by what the learning allows you to do. This set of categories is called Bloom&rsquo;s taxonomy; it is often used as a guide for educators when they are determining what students should learn within a course. To the right of each category are the &ldquo;skills acquired,&rdquo; as well as a set of real-world examples of what those
                    skills might be as applied to a specific topic.

                    A review of Table 5.1 shows that actions in the left column (or what you will be able to do with the new knowledge) has a direct influence over what needs to be learned and can even dictate the type of learning approach that is best. For example, remembering requires a type of learning based on memorization. In the case of Martin Luther King Jr. and his involvement in the civil rights movement, it is simply a matter of committing the dates to memory. When it comes to understanding (or comprehension), being able to explain how King became a leader of the movement requires that the learner not only have the ability to recall several events but also be able to understand the causes and effects of those events and how they worked together to make King a leader. Another example would be the ability to analyze. In this instance the information learned would be about not only King but also other activists such as Malcolm X. The information would have to be of such a depth that the learner could compare the events and facts about each activist.

                <p class="txt">
                    When you engage in any learning activity, take the time to understand what you will do with the knowledge once you have attained it. This can help a great deal when it comes to making decisions on how to go about learning. Using flash cards to help memorize angles does not really help you solve problems using geometry formulas. Instead, practicing problem solving with the actual formulas is a much better approach. The key is to
                    make certain the learning activity fits your needs.

                <p class="txt">
                    Several decades ago a new way of thinking about learning became very popular in education. It was based on the belief that each person has a preferred way of learning and that these preferences have to do with each person&rsquo;s natural tendencies toward one of their senses. The idea was that learning might be easier if a student sought out content that was specifically oriented to their favored sense. For example, it was thought that a student who preferred to learn visually would respond better to pictures and diagrams.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Many variations on the basic idea appeared over the years. One of the most popular was known as the VARK model. &ldquo;VARK&rdquo; is an acronym for four types of learning linked to the basic senses thought to be used by students: visual, aural, reading/writing, and kinesthetic. These learning styles might be described as follows.
                </p>

                <ul class="bl">
                    <li class="li_text">
                        <strong>Visual:</strong> The student prefers pictures, images, or a graphic display of the information to be learned. An example would be looking at an illustration that shows how to do something.
                    </li>

                    <li class="li_text"><strong>Aural:</strong> The student prefers sound as a way to learn. Examples would be listening to a lecture or a podcast.</li>

                    <li class="li_text"><strong>Reading/writing:</strong> The student prefers reading or writing as a way to learn. Examples would be reading a handout on a topic or taking notes during a lecture.</li>

                    <li class="li_text">
                        <strong>Kinesthetic:</strong> The student prefers using their body, hands, and sense of touch. An example would be doing something physical, such as examining an object rather than reading about it or looking at an
                        illustration.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="txt">
                    In many ways these ideas about learning styles made some sense. Because of this, educators encouraged students to find out about their own learning styles. They developed tests and other techniques to help students determine which sense they preferred to use for learning, and they produced learning materials that focused on each of the different senses. The goal was to ensure that each learner could participate in learning
                    activities tailored to their specific preferences.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2">The Argument About Learning Styles</h2>

                <p class="txt">
                    While it initially seemed that dividing everyone by learning styles provided a leap forward in education, continued research began to show that the fixation on this new model might not have been as effective as was once thought. In fact, in some cases the way learning styles were being used created roadblocks to learning. The rush to use learning styles failed to consider several important findings. For one thing, a person does not always prefer the same learning style for every situation. For example, some learners might enjoy lectures during the day but prefer reading in the evenings. Others may prefer looking at diagrams when learning about mechanics but prefer reading for history topics.
                </p>

                <a id="p79"></a>
                <p class="txt">
                    There are also more preferences involved in learning than just the four that became most popular. These include <em>social</em> (preferring to learn as a part of group activity), <em>solitary</em> (preferring to learn alone or using self-study), and <em>logical</em> (preferring to use logic, reasoning, etc.). These preferences can often be difficult to apply in certain learning situations. For example, learning styles that favor more social environments and that include interaction with other learners do not lend themselves well to learning requiring concentrated individual reading. Similarly, subjects like computer programming would be almost impossible to learn using an aural learning style. And while it is possible to read about how to swing a bat or how to do a medical procedure, actually learning to do so typically requires a different, more hands-on approach.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2">Using Learning Styles in a Way That Works for You</h2>

                <p class="txt">
                    The main problem with relying on learning styles relates to the belief that just one style defines your needs (Pashler et al., 2008). Rather than being constrained by a single learning style or limiting your activities to a certain kind of media, you should choose approaches that best fit your needs, given what you are trying to learn at a particular time.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">The following are just a couple of ways you might combine your learning style preference with a given learning situation.</p>

                <ul class="bl">
                    <li class="li_text">You are trying to learn how to build something but find the written instructions confusing, so you watch a video online that shows someone building the same thing.</li>

                    <li class="li_text">You have a long commute on the bus, but reading while riding makes you dizzy. You choose an aural solution by listening to prerecorded podcasts or a mobile device that reads your texts out loud.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="txt">
                    These examples show that by recognizing and understanding what different learning styles have to offer, you can use the techniques that are best suited for you and that work best at the time. You may also find yourself using two learning styles at the same time&mdash;such as when you watch a live demonstration or video in which a person shows you how to do something while verbally explaining what you are being shown. This helps reinforce the learning since it utilizes different aspects of your thinking. Using learning styles in an informed way can improve both the speed and the quality of your learning.

                            After you have finished, you will repeat the experiment with a new set of numbers, but this time you will read them aloud, wait 10 seconds, and then see how easy they are to remember. During this part of the experiment, you are free to say the numbers in any way you like.

                    There is a widely held myth that most people use only 10% of their brains and that roughly 90% of that organ just sits there, idling, going nowhere, not thinking, feeling, or learning. Meanwhile, the other 10% scrambles to keep up with all the demands screaming for attention. But that notion really <em>is</em> a myth: We now know that most of us use far more than just 10% of our brains (Beyerstein, 1999). What else do we know about the brain and how it works?

                    For a long time we knew relatively little about that unimpressive-looking lump of greyish tissue that rests in its bony case inside our heads. Often, what we thought we knew was not entirely correct. For example, some early research suggested that the two halves of the brain, called <em>cerebral hemispheres</em>, might have highly different specializations. This led to the notion that there are <em>left-brained </em>individuals, who are more logical, mathematically oriented, and verbally skilled, and <em>right-brained</em> people, who excel in art, music, and emotional intelligence. But in the end, these distinctions turned out to be of limited usefulness for learning and education, and they are not clearly supported by research.

                    Learning, explain Lim and colleagues (2019), is really all about how the human brain functions. But it was not until after advances in brain imaging that scientists were finally able to intensively study and begin to understand the relationship between brain activity and learning. <strong>Brain-based learning</strong> emerged from our understanding of how the brain perceives, understands, and learns. Its goal is to apply scientific knowledge about brain functioning to improve learning and remembering. What does science know about the brain&rsquo;s role in learning that is most useful to you as a learner?

                    To begin with, science has established that learning involves the formation of complex links among a vast array of brain cells called <em>neurons</em>. Anything science can tell us about how to promote the healthy development and functioning of neurons and how to facilitate the formation of links among them might have enormously important implications for learning.

                    The brain continues to grow neurons after birth, especially early in life. Especially important for education and learning is the finding that this process can be greatly enhanced by social interaction, exercise, healthy nutrition, and stress-free environments.

                    We know, too, that the human brain is highly plastic, meaning it has the ability to change and in a sense rewire itself. A striking example of brain plasticity is found in individuals who lose language abilities following severe damage to the parts of the brain most involved with language but who later regain these abilities as other parts of the brain relearn&mdash;are rewired&mdash;to take over lost functions (Sebastianelli et al., 2017).

                    Have you ever wondered why when you simply glance momentarily at a flying bird, you instantly recognize that it is a bird? A bird flitting by or sitting in a tree is what psychologists refer to as a <em>whole</em>. It is an entire perceptual object, a thing that can be seen, photographed, perhaps even touched. A thing that is quickly and easily identified. But note that <em>bird</em> is not simply a real-world object that can be seen and touched; it is also a <em>concept</em>&mdash;an idea. You can easily imagine a bird even if you have not seen one for months. Your mental imagery of a bird is a <em>whole</em>, very much as is the bird you see flashing by.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    When the bird darts by, however, you do not see just a bird. In addition, you immediately recognize that this is a small bird with a short, cone-shaped bill and that it is a brilliant yellow with flashes of black on its forehead and its wings. That is, you perceive not just the <em>whole</em> bird but the <em>parts</em> that make up this specific bird. As a result, even as you recognize that this is a bird, you also identify it as an American goldfinch.

                <p class="txt">
                    We are clearly not born knowing that these winged things that flit about, delighting us with their songs, are birds. Infants do not instinctively know what wings and beaks and feathers are; they are even further away from being able to distinguish between an American goldfinch and a turkey vulture or a mule. There is much learning between the infant and you who can so easily conjure up and recognize uncounted numbers of concepts and objects. You have learned an enormous amount about <em>wholes</em> and the <em>parts</em> that define them.

                <h2 class="h2">Focused Attention</h2>

                <p class="txt">
                    Studies of the brain and how we learn have led to the notion that learning is often highly dependent on the ability to focus attention. Consider, for example, that at any given time, we are constantly bombarded by an avalanche of sensations, a disorganized mixture of sounds, sights, smells, and all the other stimulation that surrounds us. But most of the time, we are unaware of the bulk of this stimulation: Our attention is focused elsewhere.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    <strong>Focused attention</strong>, or the brain&rsquo;s ability to concentrate on one specific task at a time, is central to learning; distraction (unfocused attention) plays an opposing role. It is seldom wise to pay attention to birdsong, the music on your tablet or phone, or a friend&rsquo;s text message while at the same time trying to master the content of an important college course.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Brain research has discovered that whenever we focus our attention, activity in the part of the brain related to the object of the focus increases dramatically, while activity in other parts of the brain decreases (Desimone, 2019). For example, think about trying to have a conversation with a friend at a loud party (see Figure 5.1). While you are using focused attention to be able to hear what your friend is saying, you are blocking out the other noises at the party. In this way paying specific attention to your friend suppresses your brain&rsquo;s activity that would otherwise be used to pay attention to the other stimuli around you, like music or other partygoers&rsquo; conversations.

                            The woman listening to her friend is using focused attention to be able to concentrate on the story being told. Because she is actively focusing on her friend, her brain activity, and therefore her attention, in response to other stimuli has decreased.

                <p class="txt">
                    Brain science also tells us that loss of focus can easily occur because of any of a wide variety of distractions that give rise to competing brain activity. For example, a phone ringing, a friend knocking at the door, a crow squawking, or the simple act of glancing at a coffee cup, an orange cat, or a refrigerator can trigger neural activity totally unrelated to the object of our intended focus. The opposite is also true: Especially striking and compelling stimulation related to the object of focus&mdash;such as highly relevant, attention-grabbing videos, podcasts, written text, or lectures&mdash;can do much to maintain attention and foster learning. These are valuable points to keep in mind as you select times, places, and methods for studying.

                <h2 class="h2">Unconscious and Conscious Processes</h2>

                <p class="txt">
                    Focused attention is often a deliberate, conscious process in which we are completely aware (<em>conscious</em>) of directing our attention. Consciousness implies <em>awareness</em>. It defines our subjective experience and is closely linked to deliberate action. Consciousness is marked by our awareness both of the world and of ourselves. That you remove your coat when you exit your vehicle into a sweltering day reveals your <em>consciousness</em> of how you feel (uncomfortable) as well as your <em>awareness</em> of a quality of the outside world (heat).
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    We tend to think of consciousness as a peculiarly human quality. Thus, we can easily program a well-dressed robot to respond to increasing temperature by removing its jacket&mdash;or to put one on as the temperature drops. But we do not really think that the robot responds because it becomes <em>conscious</em> of the subjective effects of temperature changes.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    We can see learning as a conscious process when we think about how a student will deliberately focus their attention when trying to learn or remember something. However, learning is also linked to processes of which we are totally unaware, processes that are <em>unconscious</em>. Take, for example, the fact that my cousin Rolf does not like milk and never willingly drinks it. Rolf did not one day consciously decide that he would learn to dislike milk. What happened was that, on more than one occasion, he drank milk that had been sitting too long in a warm place, and he became violently ill. The result was a type of what psychologists label <em>classical conditioning</em>. <strong>Classical conditioning </strong>happens when two events or objects (called <em>stimuli</em>) are repeatedly paired together. Eventually they become linked, so that being exposed to only one of the stimuli can elicit the same response as when both were present. For example, automatically reaching for your left pocket whenever a cell phone rings is an automatic reaction learned unconsciously rather than deliberately. While classical conditioning is a good explanation for many examples of unconscious learning, much of your school learning is conscious and deliberate.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h2">Memory Processes</h2>

                <p class="txt">
                    Both conscious and unconscious processes are clearly apparent in memory&mdash;a term not easily distinguished from <em>attention</em>, <em>learning</em>, and <em>awareness</em>. Simply defined, <strong>memory</strong> is the ability to retain and retrieve information about past events and experiences. Memory is what allows us to remember things so that we can actually <em>think</em>. In fact, memory is what makes each of us the person we uniquely are (Quiroga, 2017).
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Remembering can be a deliberate, conscious process directed by clear intention and awareness. This is the case, for example, when actors learn their lines. When an actor is successful, this deliberate and conscious act of learning results in the kinds of memories that psychology labels <em>explicit</em>&mdash;also termed <em>declarative</em>. They are memories that can be put into words (can be <em>declared</em>). When called on, actors can now recite their lines at will. Similarly, if someone asks you what you did last summer, you can easily put into words a description of your experiences; your memories of your summer are explicit.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    But if you, a skilled cyclist, are now asked to explain how to ride a bicycle so that a rookie cyclist can then jump on a bicycle and ride away, you will likely fail. Your memory of how to ride a bicycle is <em>implicit </em>(also called <em>nondeclarative</em>): It was learned following repeated practice on a bicycle, which resulted in your acquiring a complicated, nonverbalizable series of motor skills. Implicit, nonverbalizable memories include all past learning that cannot be recalled consciously and put into words but that can nevertheless affect behavior.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Implicit learning is evident in a wide range of motor skills like riding a bicycle, doing a triple backward somersault, typing 80 words per minute, or hitting a golf ball 300 yards. It is also typically the case for emotional learning, much of which results from past experiences that are associated with pleasant or less pleasant outcomes. Implicit learning occurs without the learner having to think <em>consciously </em>about learning and without having to focus attention deliberately to ensure being able to remember later. In general, we cannot remember when, how, or why we learned specific emotional reactions, nor can we explicitly describe the incredibly complex sequence of coordinated movements involved in the motor skills we have mastered.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Knowing how the brain works and using that information to improve learning and remembering defines brain-based learning. While education has often focused mainly on memorization of facts and accumulation of information (explicit memory), what science now knows about the importance and pervasiveness of implicit memories underlines the importance of the learner&rsquo;s social, physical, and emotional experiences. And as we have seen, brain science has also begun to uncover the importance of fostering the perception of wholes and parts and their interrelationships, the central role that focused attention plays in learning and the negative role sometimes associated with distraction, and the contribution of conscious and unconscious processes in both learning and remembering.

Others claim to increase your intellectual speed, sharpen your ability to focus and concentrate, and develop your problem-solving skills. &ldquo;Game-ified&rdquo; learning apps are based on cognitive&ndash;behavioral research that indicates that learning is improved when the brain is incrementally challenged. In other words, it is most engaging to build new learning on what you&rsquo;ve already learned while being motivated through challenging tasks like being timed, winning badges, competing against yourself or others, and tracking progress.

                            It is important to note that experts are not in agreement on the effectiveness of brain training and learning apps. Boot (2019) points out that some of the research that has looked at the effectiveness of brain apps has been highly biased and often weak from a scientific point of view. He asks, &ldquo;Do brain training games actually do anything?&rdquo; His answer: &ldquo;We just don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; The possibility remains that for some users, brain apps might sometimes result in highly significant improvements in memory, processing speed, concentration, stress reduction, mental health, and many other dimensions of intellectual functioning and emotional well-being. If you enjoy them and you think they are helping you, advises Boot, keep playing them.

                <p class="txt">This chapter examined a topic that is fundamental to your plans for success in college: understanding how humans learn.</p>

                <p class="txt">
                    It began by pointing out that not all learning is the same. For example, at a basic level, we simply memorize and maybe repeat; at a more advanced level, we think and analyze and perhaps invent astonishing technologies and machines or produce startling new theories. As Bloom and his colleagues put it, there is a hierarchy of ways in which we display our learning, beginning with remembering and progressing through understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    We saw, too, that some individuals might have different preferences for how they learn&mdash;different <em>learning styles</em>. For example, some learners prefer visual approaches; others favor aural presentations; some are more comfortable with approaches based on reading and writing; and some prefer more kinesthetic (hands-on) approaches. Some are more comfortable learning in solitary conditions; others prefer social interaction. The important point is that learning preferences should not be used to limit the learner&rsquo;s experiences. Even as everyone is different, so too are the demands of various learning situations.

                <p class="txt">
                    Finally, if we are to know how we learn, then we must understand how the brain learns, because after all, it is mostly in our brains that learning occurs. Science tells us that learning in the brain involves the formation of extraordinarily complex webs of links among brain cells (neurons). It informs us that the proliferation, health, and functioning of these neurons is closely related to nutrition, physical exercise, and social interaction. Science has also begun to clarify how the brain automatically perceives parts and wholes; it explains the importance of focused attention; it examines the interplay of both conscious and unconscious processes; and it details the role of memory processes in all sorts of learning. Brain-based learning has to do with applying to your learning the most recent and reliable information about brain functioning.
                </p>

                <p class="txt">
                    Learning can be complex and often requires considerable effort, but if you use learning styles and brain-based learning to your advantage, you can increase your chances of learning and retaining information successfully!
