<p class="txt">Think about all the times you write in any given day: lists, discussions, texts, class notes, letters, emails&mdash;the list could go on and on. Most students today type on a phone or computer more than write with pen and paper, but the underlying skill is the same. You are conveying your thoughts onto a surface (paper or screen) so others can take your words and understand your thoughts. If this thought exchange leaves the writer and recipient on the same page, so to speak, then true communication has occurred. That is the goal. Writing is an important skill for you to practice and master because how you communicate with others translates into all areas of your life, including your academic and professional roles. </p>


<p class="txt">When you consider writing as a way to learn, just as you use reading, mathematical formulas, and specialized equipment to learn, you can develop strategies to improve your writing for various situations. You don&rsquo;t read a comic book in the same way you read your chemistry textbook, and you don&rsquo;t text your friends in the same way you write to your professor asking for an extension. In many ways you know these unwritten rules intuitively, but some academic writing guidelines you may not understand as easily. That is why you have to continue to study writing and practice it on the college level even though by now you have been writing for many years. Writing well and appropriately in different academic situations is a skill you can learn. And just as you might have fallen a time or two when learning to ride a bicycle, you may make some mistakes when practicing your academic writing. That is how you learn a skill. Just get up again and keep writing! </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section-body">
			

		<p class="txt">Writing&mdash;the word alone can make students sweat, but it doesn&rsquo;t need to be that way. Writing is a skill you must learn and practice like any other. When you first begin a new job, you expect to be trained and have your supervisor explain your duties. You do not feel incapable of handling the job or doing well, because you must first go through a training process or start out as a beginner. Writing is the same way, and in time you can become a strong academic writer, just as you will become a productive employee after training. Students sometimes feel like they should immediately know how to write in college because they have written since such a young age. That is true, but academic and professional writing is different from creative and casual writing. </p>


		<p class="txt">Have you noticed that even though cell phones were first designed for us to call one another and communicate by speaking, we now use them just as much, if not more, for emailing and texting? That means writing, though at a casual level generally. The point is, writing is a part of everyday life, no matter what you do, and how you write is the impression people will have of you. </p>


		<p class="txt">When hiring job applicants, employers place communication and good writing skills at the top of the qualifications list. That makes sense because professionals write for so many reasons: to order products and services, to sell and market items, to engineer structures and systems, to create lesson plans, to develop contracts between interested parties, as well as to present theories, ideologies, and innovations. Every career field uses written communication as a basis of operation. Learning academic writing skills will enable you to write well in any situation for any career. You will know the basic structure and rules for writing, which will allow you to communicate effectively. </p>

<a id="p91"></a>

		<p class="txt">Furthermore, writing is communication, and communication is the way we connect withothers. Writing is one of the communication methods we can use to tell others what we thinkand know, and as such, is the key to your success in college and in the workplace. Writingserves to enrich your life by deepening your understanding of your own knowledge andincreasing your critical thinking skills. Arguably, writing is one of the most important skillsyou will ever learn. </p>

    </div>
   

    <div class="section-body">


				<p class="txt">Writing is not only relevant to learning, it is the foundation to most formal knowledge acquisition. Sometimes students don&rsquo;t realize just how important writing is as a learning activity in their university-level studies. In part, this lack of understanding results from thinking of writing in terms of mechanics (i.e., grammar, paragraphing, punctuation) or even the logistics of writing that include writing materials and typing skills. Certainly, these mechanical and physical skills are important for writing to be effective, but writing is more than mechanics; it&rsquo;s basically a learning process. </p>



				<h2 class="h2">How Writing Contributes to Learning </h2>

				  id="img6.1" />
				<figcaption>

				  <p class="caption">University-level writing may seem daunting, but the more you practice, even through daily journaling, the more confident you&rsquo;ll become in your writing style.</p>
				</figcaption>
			  </figure>
		


				<p class="txt">More specifically, writing is a transformative process in that it requires you to engage in reshaping knowledge. When you write, you are usually in some way changing knowledge you already have. It may be a concept, an assumption, a fact, or a conclusion you have reached. But because thinking precedes writing, you first have to think about your subject, analyze it, and select and arrange words to express particular thoughts you now want to communicate about that initial idea. </p>

				
				<p class="txt">To put it another way, when you sit down to write, your thoughts don&rsquo;t come to you neatly in sequential order. As Gail Poirrier (1997) explains, writing engages you in a dialectical process in which you must discuss/debate/sort out (in your own mind) what you want to put on the screen or paper in front of you. As you do this, you always have some level of discovery of new thoughts, insights, or conclusions. It&rsquo;s almost impossible to write in this manner without increasing your understanding of the topic under consideration or without increasing your knowledge base. For example, if you were asked to write a paper on a topic about which you know very little, you would have to do some serious thinking and possibly research before you could write about it. For instance, if you are not very familiar with the concept of <em>globalization</em>, you could look it up online and read a few articles about this topic. This quick review may help you remember a trip you once took to another country or an article you read about a partnership between a company in the United States and a company in Mexico. You can now at least make some general comparisons to knowledge you already have from previous learning experiences and reading to come up with something about which to write on the subject of globalization. This is how academic writing works&mdash;some of your thoughts may not end up in the written document; for instance, your trip to another country may just be a nice memory with few useful details about globalization, but the article you read may serve as the basis of your understanding of this topic. And even if a writing experience only reinforces an understanding that you already have of a particular subject, it is still valuable because it solidifies learning. Writing in this case becomes a means of strengthening what you already know! </p>

<a id="p92"></a>

				<p class="txt">This way that writing helps people learn what they may already know is one of the reasons personal journaling is so popular. You may think journaling your day&rsquo;s events isn&rsquo;t a valuable use of your time since you were there and already know what happened, but writing down what you did and what you were thinking about your experiences may clarify your thoughts about why something made you happy or angry. You may even try to journal what you were thinking when you first learned a new topic in a class. Were you excited, confused, bored? Do you understand what you still need to do to grasp all the concepts in the lesson? This written introspection and the general practice of becoming more aware of your own thinking can help you manage how you react to future experiences and challenges. </p>


				<p class="txt">Writing is at the core of learning, and you will find that no matter how rusty your skills are at the onset, the processes of thinking, writing, and learning will sand that rust right off. The more you practice writing, the more comfortable you&rsquo;ll become. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if your first attempts are shaky. That is natural when you start doing anything more intensely than you might have in the past. Most colleges and universities offer an entry course to help students get back in the swing of things. Pay attention to your writing task and have faith in your ability to write and to continually improve your writing skills. </p>


				<p class="txt">Professors do not design university-level writing assignments to ask you to repeat memorized information. Very little learning results from such factual exchanges. Instead, university-level writing assignments require you to think critically about a subject. Thinking critically may require you to seek a solution to a problem, explain various perspectives, analyze a topic, synthesize information, evaluate data, or reflect on how to apply knowledge in a particular situation. In each case, the assignment sets the stage for an intellectual quest in which you seek to capture knowledge, connect it to your experience and understanding, and use words to define your thinking. That challenging quest is called learning, and the writing process used to communicate it to others becomes a learning process. </p>


				<h2 class="h2">Learning to Use Appropriate Language in Writing </h2>

				<p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s talk for a minute about the language of academia. Think about the way you use language when interacting with your boss or an important client. Now contrast that with the way you use language at home with your family and loved ones. Is it the same? If you are like most people, the answer is probably &ldquo;no.&rdquo; That is true because of the level and formality of these relationships. It is as inappropriate to use casual or intimate language at work as it is to use very formal language with your significant other in an intimate setting. </p>


				<p class="txt">Think about writing a note about needed groceries you may leave for others at home. Youmay have a system in your house such as an ongoing shopping list. If this is the case, youmay get away with writing a one-word addition to the list&mdash;<em>milk</em>. If you do not have such asystem in place, you may need to leave a written note in a visible location for the primaryshopper and include slightly more detail&mdash;possibly <em>need milk</em>, or <em>buy skim milk, not whole and check expiration date!</em> In a workplace, a supervisor will probably need more information for purchasing requests, including a justification, preferences, costs, approved vendors, and delivery logistics. You likely will not be able to leave a sticky note in the breakroom saying <em>buy better software</em>. </p>

<a id="p93"></a>

				<p class="txt">In the 1950s a linguist named Thomas Bertram Reid (1956) introduced the concept of <strong><em>register of language</em></strong>. Many linguists quickly adopted this theory to describe language. The idea refers to the fact that the formality of language is a continuum ranging from very formally structured language (think about a bailiff swearing in a witness in a courtroom or the president of the United States taking the oath of office) to very intimate language (think about a mother cooing to her new baby or a group of teenagers congregating on a Saturday night). Reid identified essentially five levels of registers (Joos, 1967). </p>


					<ul class="bl">

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Frozen register:</strong> A level of language that does not change, including oaths, biblical quotations, and famous sayings. The Pledge of Allegiance is a good example.</li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Formal register:</strong> The language of work and school. It is composed of extensive vocabulary, employs correct syntax and spelling, and requires complete, grammatically correct sentence structure. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Consultative register:</strong> A version of the formal register used in less structured conversations. It is an interchange, but it does not assume connectedness between the parties. This level is considered respectful. </li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Casual register:</strong> The language of friends and acquaintances. Connectedness between the parties is assumed, so conversations often leave out background information. Private, shared vocabulary is often used, and ellipsis (unfinished thought) and slang are common.</li>

					<li class="li_text"><strong>Intimate register:</strong> Nonpublic interaction. This is the language between lovers, siblings, and close family members. Intonation is more important than wording or grammar. </li>

					</ul>
					
			
			
				<p class="txt">You may or may not have really thought about this language breakdown, but you understand it intuitively. You would not talk to the CEO of your company the same way you would talk to your friends while playing darts at a bar on Saturday night. However, it is important to realize that this same concept is relevant to the kind of writing you will do in a university setting. As a participant in higher education, you are expected to use the formal register when you are writing academic papers. It is the language of education, or what is often referred to as academic English. </p>


				<p class="txt">When you post to a university course discussion forum, your professors expect you to use the consultative register. If you live in the world of texting and abbreviated email acronyms (things like LOL, b/c, OMG, and IMHO), using the consultative register might constitute a pretty big change in how you approach your written work. Many students initially think they can approach their discussion forum postings in the same way they approach texting their friends (casual register). It does not work, but don&rsquo;t worry&mdash;writing in consultative and academic English is not hard to master. It just takes practice and attention. </p>

    <div class="section-body">


			<p class="txt">The first thing to remember in building writing skills is that you can always go back and change what you have written, so don&rsquo;t think you have to be perfect from the moment you begin. Writing well takes significant revision. Perhaps even more important, you need to understand that the feedback, or criticism, you receive about your writing skills in an academic setting is not something you should take personally. When your instructors or teaching assistants point out errors and provide suggestions for improvement, they are helping you hone your skills, not attacking your ability or character. Accept the comments and use them to keep improving. </p>

<a id="p94"></a>

			<p class="txt">Many students have not written a formal paper since high school (and perhaps not even then). You may have taken multiple-choice, true/false, or essay question exams to measure learning rather than completing a more structured writing assignment. If you think back, you most likely can&rsquo;t remember much of what you learned after taking a test. However, when you must organize your thoughts and consider what is important in the assignment and then convey that understanding in writing, you will retain far more of the information, which then becomes knowledge. </p>


			<h2 class="h2">Building Confidence About Writing </h2>

			<p class="txt">Even students who have taken several college courses may still have difficulties and concerns regarding their writing skills. Many students find it difficult to decide where to start or what to write about. Most of your assignments will contain specific instructions about the topic, what subjects must be covered, how long the paper should be, and how many sources you should use. If you have questions, make sure to ask your professors, and take notes when they give you answers. Comparing notes with other students in class may also clarify the assignment instructions. </p>


			<p class="txt">Throughout your college coursework, you will write papers. College professors will assign many kinds of writing assignments of varying levels. Likewise, you will have various audiences for your written work. Again, don&rsquo;t be overanxious about writing papers. You will learn the process one step at a time, will have many resources available online, and can practice and learn at your own pace. </p>


			<p class="txt">Most universities have specific online writing resources, often called Online Writing Labs or Online Writing Centers, that you can access anytime from anywhere. Most contain the same information that is available in a writing handbook or style guide, but some have tutors available through email, online chat, and phone support; these tutors will provide the guidance that you need to write your paper as the assignment requires. Some universities even offer paper review services through their writing centers. </p>


			<p class="txt">Many online writing resources also contain automated tools that allow you to practice grammar and writing and then receive immediate feedback. You can typically practice as often or as much as you need, and no one tracks what you do for a grade. These are excellent resources for practicing and brushing up on writing elements that may confuse you. Universities may also provide writing coaches through your entire beginning courses. Remember, you are never without guidance and support. </p>

        <h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Communication Skills: Communicating Through Email</strong></h4>
        <div class="aside_content">
        
		
			<p class="txt">Most students are already familiar with the concept of communicating through instant, electronic messages. Faculty are used to email as well, but it serves different purposes for students and faculty. As entering members of the higher education world, students need to recognize that fact and use email with professors and other professionals at their college as a more formal communication method. Remember the following tips. </p>

	<a id="p95"></a>
				<ul class="bl">

					<li class="li_text">You don&rsquo;t have to write in an awkward, stilted tone, but you also should not use slang, texting abbreviations, and emoticons.</li>

					<li class="li_text">Give your recipient a little background about why you are asking the question, and look first in other class documents or online to see if the answer to your question is available to you elsewhere instead of just starting off with something like &ldquo;when&rsquo;s the quiz?&rdquo;&mdash;a fact that likely is on the class schedule.</li>

					<li class="li_text">Add the topic of your message in the subject line and identify yourself and what class you&rsquo;re in so the professor knows how best to address your situation.</li>

					<li class="li_text">Keep emails as brief and direct as possible, and be sure to respond to emails in a timely manner.</li>

					</ul>

			<p class="txt">These guidelines are not meant to discourage casual conversations; both methods simply have different purposes. However, overall, your emails to your professors should have a specific purpose and contain your contact information and your question or concern.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>


<p class="txt">We write all the time, so it only makes sense to practice this skill. While you&rsquo;re in college, one of the most important reasons to work on improving your writing is to make learning your discipline-specific content more effective. Beyond college, strong writing skills will benefit you in all aspects of your life. You can build your confidence in your writing skills through practice and the recognition that various language levels exist in different writing situations. Language is so dynamic and flexible that we can easily transition between casual conversations and formal situations just by changing the words we choose and the sentences we construct. Learning how to speak and write appropriately as you make your way through your college experience is part of the education you receive. This skill will help you navigate professional encounters with supervisors, peers, clients, customers, and vendors. </p>
