  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  <p class="intro">Sebastian&#39;s school uses an unusual <strong>grading system&#8212;</strong>one that might be viewed as quite controversial.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
	 <div class="single-column">
			
		<p class="txt">In fact, grading and grading systems are controversial topics. Grading systems are sometimes also referred to as <em>marking systems</em>, although marks and grades mean somewhat different things. Strictly speaking, <strong>marks</strong> are scores on individual assessments, whereas grades are summative&#8212;they summarize performance at the end of an instructional period. Thus, one can say that Sebastian&#39;s <em>mark</em> on the first science quiz was 40; on the second, his mark might be 42. But his final, year-end <em>grade</em> is another matter. And, depending on the grading system used, it might take any one of a variety of different forms.</p>

		<p class="txt">There is no single, widely accepted grading system. Educators can&#39;t seem to agree about which approach is best and for what purpose. As a result, schools and school systems set up their own grading systems. Sometimes teachers follow them to the letter; sometimes they ignore them.</p>

		<p class="txt">Recently, however, there have been important changes in the ways in which an increasing number of schools and school districts grade their learners&#8212;changes that are linked to legislation such as ESSA.</p>

		<p class="txt">One of the most important features of ESSA is the requirement that all states develop educational standards and that assessment and instruction be aligned with these standards. Furthermore, states (hence schools) are required to show the extent to which standards are being met and the interventions that are being implemented for lower achieving schools and learners with special needs. Essentially, this has led to <em>standards-based education</em>&#8212;educational systems in which, through a <em>backward design process</em>, the curriculum is based directly on the standards, or goals, that society wants for its children; assessments are designed to gauge the extent to which goals are being met; and instructional approaches are selected specifically to maximize the attainment of goals.</p>

	<a id="p435"></a>	
		<p class="txt">Standards-based education has also led to the increasing use of <em>standards-based grading systems</em>. As we will see shortly, these are grading systems that reflect how students are doing with respect to very specific educational goals.</p>

		<p class="key-point">Grading is one of the most important things that teachers do. Grades can be highly meaningful and clear for both parents and students, or they can be confusing and ambiguous. They can be enormously motivating&#8212;even inspiring&#8212;or they can be devastating. In fact, grading and grading practices are among the most often criticized aspects of schooling.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="inner-section">
		<h2 class="h2">Criticisms of Grades and Grading Systems</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
		<p class="txt">There are some, like Kohn (2012), who think grades and grading systems should be abandoned. Why? For any and all of the following three reasons.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">First, one possible effect of grades, says Kohn (2012), is to weaken student interest in the material being graded. This phenomenon is known as the <strong>overjustification effect&#8212;</strong>an effect that results from reinforcing a previously unreinforced activity so that the motivation for engaging in the activity now becomes extrinsic (external) rather than intrinsic (related to the activity itself; Peters &#38; Vollmer, 2014). For example, Kai, who has an intrinsically motivated interest in social studies, reads books and articles in the area and discusses related topics because the activities involved in doing so are delightful for her: They are what we defined as reinforcing in Chapter 3.</p>

		<p class="txt">However, overjustification research suggests that if Kai&#39;s interest in social studies is now put to the test in a social studies class, and her knowledge and efforts result in high grades, her motivation will gradually change. In the end, instead of reading social studies because of the enchantment and fascination associated with her intrinsic interest in the subject, she will read it because of the grades she earns (an extrinsic source of reinforcement).</p>

		<p class="key-point">Put simply, as the external goal becomes more important, intrinsic interest in the subject declines.</p>

		<p class="txt">And if the rewards&#8212;that is, the high grades&#8212;cease, the initial level of intrinsic interest that led her to read social studies in her free time may never return.</p>

		<p class="txt">Second, grades sometimes encourage students to select the easiest options&#8212;those for which they are most likely to get the highest marks. They do this because they are clever.</p>

		<p class="txt">Being <em>successfully intelligent</em> (in Sternberg&#39;s [2015b] sense of the phrase), they have adapted to a system that rewards learners whose choices are focused very precisely on activities related to high grades.</p>

		<p class="txt">And third, Kohn (2012) suggests that grades may undermine higher level thinking. Students ask themselves, &quot;Will this be on the test?&quot; &quot;Will I be graded on this?&quot;</p>

		<p class="key-point">If the answer is no, the material receives no more attention.</p>

	<a id="p436"></a>
		<p class="txt">And if the assessments on which grades are based are exclusively or mainly directed at simple recall&#8212;which, as we saw earlier, is very often the case&#8212;that is where the intelligent learner&#39;s efforts will be directed. (See <em>In the Classroom: What the Zen Master Said</em>).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">In the Classroom: What the Zen Master Said</h3>
        <p class="txt">Kohn (2012) tells the story of a student who asks his Zen master how long it will take to reach enlightenment.</p>
		
        <p class="ext">&quot;Ten years,&quot; the master replies.</p>
		
		<p class="ext">&quot;But what if I study very hard?&quot;</p>

		<p class="ext">&quot;Then it will take 20 years,&quot; says the Zen master.</p>

		<p class="ext">&quot;No, but what if I study very, very, hard?&quot;</p>

		<p class="ext">&quot;In that case,&quot; the Zen master replies, &quot;it will take 30 years.&quot; (Kohn, 2012, p. 11)</p>

		<p class="txt">How do you suppose the Zen master would explain his answers?</p>
		
        <p class="txt">One possible explanation is this: If you have one eye on the goal&#8212;enlightenment, in this case&#8212;that leaves only one eye on the tasks that need to be accomplished to reach the goal. From a grading point of view, the Zen lesson is that if the student is focused too narrowly on grades, true learning will suffer.</p>

	    <p class="txt">Are there other explanations?</p>
		</div>
	</section>

		<p class="txt">Grades are the target of a variety of other criticisms, such as the following.</p>

		<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Students often perceive grades as unfair.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Grades can be confusing.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Sometimes grades are so inconsistent as to be meaningless.</li>
          <li class="li_text">There is evidence that under some circumstances, grades contribute little to motivation and learning.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Grades are incompatible with mastery approaches to learning because if all learners master a unit, all should receive the same grade.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Grades tend to foster uniformity among learners at the expense of individuality.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Pressure to get high grades may contribute to cheating.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Grades foster a high level of competition among learners, to the detriment of cooperation. and</li>
          <li class="li_text">Honest grading almost invariably means that someone will fail&#8212;or will, at the very least, be judged significantly inferior.</li>
       </ul>

		<h2 class="h2">Reacting to a Grading System</h2>
		<div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">As Fenwick and Parsons (2009) explain, teachers basically have three choices when making a decision about grading.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">1. Fight the System</h3>
		<p class="txt">If you don&#39;t like current grading practices, fight for the right to impose your own. That is what Lynden Dorval, physics teacher for some 35 years, decided to do. His school had effectively outlawed the use of zeros for assignments not handed in, and the principal had issued a directive to that effect. Instead, teachers were to use what were termed <em>situational codes</em>. For example, NHI meant &quot;not handed in&quot;; OMI indicated that the student&#39;s assignment mark would be omitted and not included in the grade calculation; LDI indicated that learning seemed to have occurred, but the assignment had not been completed.</p>
	
		<p class="txt">Dorval ignored the principal&#39;s directive, failed to use the codes, and continued to hand out zeros. But, he explains, students were always given an opportunity to make up a missing assignment. As a result, zeros were rare.</p>
	
		<p class="txt">The outcome was that Dorval was suspended and, finally, fired (The <em>Huffington Post</em>, 2013). Thus, fighting the system can have costs. (We will look at the no-zero policy later in this chapter.)</p>

	<a id="p438"></a>	
		<h3 class="h3">2. Subvert the System</h3>
		<p class="txt">Teachers who seem to be complying with an imposed grading system might actually be subverting that system. It&#39;s conceivable, for example, that if Dorval had given his students say, a 5 or even a 10 for a missing assignment, he might not have been seen to be in violation of the school&#39;s policy. The effect on his students&#39; motivation and on their willingness to supply the missing assignment might not have been very different from that obtained by giving them zeros. Nor would the effect on the final grade have been very different.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">3. Deemphasize Grading</h3>
		<p class="txt">There is something to be said for deemphasizing grading, focusing instead on improving teaching and learning, rewarding initiative, promoting self-directed learning, and encouraging self-reflection and self-assessment. However, in the era of high-stakes testing, this is not always an easy thing to do.</p>
	
		<p class="txt">Nevertheless, to think that teachers should want to do any of these three things&#8212;fight the system, subvert it, or deemphasize it&#8212;presupposes that they are convinced that the grading system is not a good one. The truth is that many grading systems, intelligently applied, are very useful, fair, and informative&#8212;which, of course, leads us to a fourth choice.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">4. Accept and Work With the School&#39;s Grading System</h3>
		<p class="txt">There is a fourth option. In most cases it makes little sense not to work with the school&#39;s grading system. If a school hands out only letter grades&#8212;say, A, B, C, D, or F&#8212;or only evaluative comments&#8212;<em>excellent</em>, <em>satisfactory</em>, <em>in need of improvement</em>&#8212;that, in most cases, is precisely what the teacher needs to do.</p>
	
		<p class="txt">In fact, in some cases teachers really do not have much leeway if they want to maintain good relations with administrators (not to mention, retain their positions). However, even when they work within the system, they can sometimes modify it, use variations, or supplement it with other approaches.</p>

    <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What is standards-based grading?</span></h2>
  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
    <p class="intro">As we saw earlier, a standards-based grading (SBG) system requires establishing criteria (standards) that specify clear objectives for each instructional unit.</p>
	</div>
   <div class="section-body">
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">SBG is basically a criterion-referenced approach to assessment: It compares the learner&#39;s performance to a standard (a criterion) rather than to the performance of other learners. The assessment that SBG provides is a reflection of the extent to which a clear standard has been met.</p>

<a id="p439"></a>
	<p class="txt">Research on SBG indicates that it is associated with a number of positive educational outcomes. For example, Dolliver (2018) found that it was positively related to student achievement. In fact, when Pollio and Hochbein (2015) looked at the effects of a newly introduced SBG system on the performance of more than 2,400 eleventh-grade students on a state-mandated standardized achievement test, they found that the number of students passing the state test approximately doubled.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Implementing Standards-Based Grading</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">SBG systems can be very challenging to implement. They require not only very explicit statements of learning goals but also assessments that can clearly determine whether the goals have been met.</p>

	<p class="txt">Teachers involved in implementing a change from traditional to standards-based assessment require different kinds of help and support. When Gogerty (2017) interviewed 12 teachers involved in transitioning from traditional to standards-based assessment, she found that three kinds of support were especially crucial: attending district-led professional development sessions; being provided with an appropriate, standards-based grade book; and having a collaborative team of teachers with whom to work. In this connection, <em>professional learning communities</em>&#8212;formal, collaborative groupings of educators within schools or across school districts or even states&#8212;can play an important role.</p>
	</div>
   </div>
	
	<h2 class="h2">Comparing With Traditional Grading</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Table 11.1 compares traditional grading systems with SBG systems. The main advantages of a traditional grading system have to do with its familiarity and simplicity and with the fact that it provides information that allows easy comparisons among students, which simplifies selecting learners for various purposes.</p>

	<p class="txt">The disadvantages of the traditional approach are much the same as those that result from the excessive use of high-stakes standardized tests. Both encourage students to work for grades rather than strive to become more competent, self-motivated, and self-regulated learners. Both reward teachers for approaches to instruction that don&#39;t encourage creativity and experimentation but that focus most directly on teaching that leads to high student grades. And the numbers and letter grades that summarize learner achievement say very little about students&#39; higher order thinking skills, attitudes, and other abilities&#8212;and perhaps very little, as well, about the extent to which learners have reached learning objectives.</p>

Another disadvantage is that it doesn&#39;t always provide information that can be used to compare learners or to select them for admission to special programs.</p>

	<p class="txt">Proponents of SBG argue that it is more meaningful than more traditional approaches to grading. For example, although an SBG system might still result in a letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F), each of these letters has clear meaning. An <em>A</em>, for example, might mean that the student has demonstrated proficiency with respect to all standards based on the objectives for this course and has gone beyond minimum levels of proficiency on at least some standards; a <em>B</em> might indicate proficiency on all standards; a <em>C</em> might mean that the most important standards, though not all of them, have been met; a <em>D</em> could mean a smaller number of criteria have been satisfied; and an <em>F</em> would indicate that few, if any, of the standards have been met.</p>

	<p class="txt">Many SBG systems do not provide letter or number grades but simply indicate whether a specific learning objective has been met. And most do not include anything other than performance vis-&agrave;-vis standards as indicators of achievement. For example, they do not normally reward or penalize effort, improvement, class participation, attendance, or good manners.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Recall that a rubric is a written set of guidelines for evaluating a project, performance, or assignment. It typically lists the criteria that will be used to judge the work, together with evaluative descriptors that reflect the various criteria. Criteria are often scaled using a range of verbal descriptors such as <em>poor</em>, <em>fair</em>, <em>average</em>, <em>above average</em>, <em>superior</em>, and <em>excellent</em>. For example, Figure 11.3 shows a rubric that might be used to assess mathematics performance in the upper elementary grades. The rubric is written in the first person, so the teacher can use it for assessment or the student can use it for self-assessment. While rubrics are common in elementary school, especially for performance-based assessments, they can also be very useful in postsecondary educational settings (for examples, see Carnegie Mellon University, 2016).</p>

        <p class="txt">Checklists and rating scales are also often used in grading systems. As we saw in Chapter 7, these are especially useful in performance assessments, and they are most common in grading systems for the early grades. Checklists are simply lists of the elements that characterize successful performance of a task. As Figure 11.4 shows, a checklist usually consists of nonsequential and nonevaluative items that are simply checked as being present or not present.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Self-Assessment</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">A general goal of most educational systems is to develop learners who can eventually take control of their own learning. These are learners who, using today&#39;s jargon, become self-regulated learners. Self-regulated learners select their own goals, devise and apply strategies for reaching those goals, monitor and evaluate their progress, and make adjustments in their strategies&#8212;and sometimes in their goals&#8212;as required. They are the learners who have become, or are on their way to becoming, autonomous, self-directed learners.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">Yet what happens when you allow learners to assess their own learning and give them the responsibility of assigning their own grades? Perhaps surprisingly, a number of studies indicate that, at least for older students, there is little difference between the grades they give themselves and those an instructor might have given them. Lopez-Pastor, Fernandez-Balboa, Santos Pastor, and Aranda (2012) compared professor-determined grades with students&#39; self-grades and a third set of grades that had been negotiated between the professor and individual students. On the 10-point scale in use at these colleges, the average difference between any of these grades was never more than 1.5. Furthermore, self scores tended to be slightly lower than final negotiated scores. Similarly, Babaii, Taghaddomi, and Pashmforoosh (2017) found that when learners were presented with scoring criteria for self-evaluation, correspondence between learner and teacher assessment was high.</p>

	<p class="txt">Although self-assessment in the lower grades is unlikely to take the form of assigning final grades, one goal of the educational system is to develop autonomous, self-regulated learners who, among other things, have developed some of the skills involved in monitoring and evaluating their efforts in relation to instructional objectives. These aren&#39;t skills that are naturally present in most learners. Research suggests that to help learners develop self-assessment skills, it is useful to give them models of weak and strong performances and to encourage them to reflect on their work and their progress (e.g., Lin-Siegler, Shaenfield, &#38; Elder, 2015; Jax, 2016).</p>
    
    <a id="p445"></a>
    <p class="txt">One common way of improving self-assessment skills in learners is to provide them with self-assessment rubrics (Wang, 2017). These often take the form of simple diagrams or charts on which they can plot their self-evaluations (an example is provided in Figure 11.6). Also, discussions with individual students dealing with their accomplishments and with the effectiveness of their efforts can do much to foster the skills of self-assessment.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Peer Assessment</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Grading is an act of judgment&#8212;or at the very least, it implies a judgment. However, teachers, and students themselves, are not the only possible sources of educational assessment: <strong>Peer assessment</strong>, evaluation by peers&#8212;by equals&#8212;is another. In peer assessment, students give their classmates feedback on the quality of their written or spoken performances. In rare cases, peers might also be involved in contributing to grades, although that is uncommon and may give rise to problems.</p>

	<p class="txt">Peer assessment can take a variety of forms. For example, Hwang, Chen, and Sung (2018) describe a music class in which peer assessment occurred not through face-to-face interaction but by having peer assessors watch videos of other students performing. Not only did this process reduce the student-musicians nervousness, it was also shown to help learner progress. Formanek, Wenger, Buxner, Impey, and Sonam (2017) report a study in which peers graded assignments that were part of a massive open online course in astronomy. Students who took part in peer-assessment were more engaged in the course and more likely to complete it and do well in it.</p>
    
   <a id="p446"></a> 
    <p class="txt">Peer assessment is, in some ways, excellent preparation for real life after school, in which the assessments and opinions of coworkers can be very important. In this sense peer assessment is an important form of authentic assessment&#8212;assessment that reflects the constraints and demands of the real world. In addition, peer assessment gives every student an opportunity to learn how assessments are carried out. As a result, it can be highly useful for clarifying instructional objectives and performance criteria. Furthermore, it can contribute enormously to the development of self-assessment skills&#8212;skills that are fundamental to becoming self-directed learners.</p>

	<p class="txt">Implementing peer assessment in the classroom requires that criteria for assessments be specific, clear, and understood by all students. Simple templates or rubrics to guide student assessments are highly useful. In the early grades, for example, a template might take the form of a single evaluation sheet on which the peer assessor simply answers yes or no to questions such as: <em>Is the story interesting? Does it have exciting events? Does it use interesting words?</em> Keeping in mind the importance of positive feedback, assessors might also be asked to tell their partners what they like most about the story. In higher grades, templates become more detailed.</p>
    
    <p class="txt">By using templates to specify the criteria on which assessments are to be based, students can effectively provide feedback on each other&#39;s written stories, mathematical computations, oral presentations, musical offerings, and so on. Peer feedback can then be used formatively to improve written or oral work before it is handed in to the teacher for assessment and perhaps grading.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">However, teachers need to take into consideration the possibility that personal relationships can affect peer assessments, sometimes making them unfair and unduly harsh or other times excessively kind and embarrassingly positive. Lin (2018) reports a study in which peer assessments were conducted by means of a Facebook-based application; assessments were either public (assessors&#39; names were revealed) or anonymous. Whereas the anonymous group provided more cognitive feedback in the form of suggestions for improvement, the identifiable group offered more affective feedback in the form of either supporting or not supporting the work. Interestingly, while those whose work had been assessed anonymously thought they had learned more from the assessments, they also thought that the assessments were less fair than did those whose peer assessors were identified.</p>

	<p class="txt">Peer assessment and feedback based on clear rubrics or other guidelines has been found to improve learning and performance both for the person doing the assessing and for the student whose work is being assessed (Deiglmayr, 2018; Tsivitanidou, Constantinou, Labudde, Ronnebeck, &#38; Ropohl, 2018). Positive feedback, note Lu and Law (2012), is especially important.</p>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Portfolios</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Grades can also be based on portfolios. Recall that a portfolio is a collection of actual samples of a student&#39;s performances. Portfolios might be representative samples, or they might contain the learner&#39;s best works. In early grades portfolios might consist of samples of printing, drawings, solutions for problems in mathematics, and little stories. In later grades they might include a more structured sampling of student productions. Often, they contain audio, video, or photo recordings. In some cases they might consist entirely of electronic records or of web-based entries such as blogs.</p>

	<p class="txt">The validity and usefulness of portfolio and peer assessments, as is the case for all other forms of assessment, are highly dependent on having a clear understanding of the standards by which judgments are being made. Criteria for evaluating portfolios need to be clearly understood by both teachers and students. This is one reason that scoring rubrics are essential. Yet even with good rubrics, serious problems often arise when assessing portfolios. Agreement among different raters is frequently low, and their validity is weak. Furthermore, raters typically provide global assessments such as <em>good</em>, <em>bad</em>, or <em>excellent</em>, rather than more precise indicators such numbers or even letter grades. However, validity and reliability can be increased by improving scoring rubrics and by training raters on the use of the rubrics (Perez-Cotapos &#38; Taut, 2016).</p>

	<p class="txt">Portfolios tend to involve students in the learning process and can significantly enhance motivation and learning (Boumediene, Berrahal, &#38; Harji, 2016; Mahayukti, Dantes, Candiasa, &#38; Marhaeni, 2018). And they are a useful assessment tool for teachers, especially for formative purposes.</p>

	</div>

	<h2 class="h2">Points-Based Grading</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">One of the most common approaches to calculating grades is <strong>points-based grading</strong>. This system typically calculates the student&#39;s academic achievement as a weighted total of the various points attained on different quizzes and tests. Points awarded might be numerical or letter based (A, B, C, D, and F).</p>

	<p class="txt">A <strong>grade point average (GPA)</strong> is a common expression of points-based grading. The GPA is simply a summative evaluation of a student&#39;s performance, arrived at by adding the number of grade points achieved in each of a collection of courses and dividing by the total number of courses. As a result, the GPA is the student&#39;s mean performance for the term, the year, or the entire multiyear program.</p>

	<p class="txt">There are many different points-based grading systems. These include percentage systems in which the highest and lowest possible marks are 100 and 0; 9-point systems ranging from 0 to 9; 10-point systems; 7-point systems; 5-point systems; 4-point systems; and letter grade systems. Interestingly, in their practical application, most of these systems are really percentage systems, no matter how they are disguised.</p>

<a id="p448"></a>
	<p class="txt">In many schools and universities, specific percentage guidelines are given for allocation of letter grades or numerical grades. For example, in a 10-point system, each point might be equally weighted and worth 9.3 percentage points. In this system, a 10 is equivalent to 93&#37; (10 &#215; 9.3); an 8 would be comparable to 74.4&#37; (8 &#215; 9.3), and a 5 would be the same as 46.5&#37;. Figure 11.7 shows examples of percentage and letter grade equivalents for a 5-point system and for a 9-point system. Note that percentage and letter equivalents might be very different in different jurisdictions, even when they both use either a 5- or a 9-point grading system.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Grading Practices in Schools</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="key-point">Very few teachers use only one of the various approaches to grading available.</p>

	<p class="txt">Most will use a combination of formal and informal approaches that might include rubrics and portfolios, performance assessments, criterion-referenced assessments, self-assessments, and one or more grade point systems. For final summative evaluations, teachers will typically need to adhere to the school&#39;s accepted grading policies. Those policies might be quite different in schools that have moved to SBG systems.</p>

	<p class="txt">School report cards are normally designed for one of three specific kinds of grades: letter grades, number grades, or verbal descriptors. While some cards provide space for two or even all three of these items, many will use only one.</p>

	<p class="txt">Most grading systems are relatively straightforward, although as we have seen, they can vary widely. While letter grade systems are usually limited (A, B, C, D, and F), dozens of different numerical systems are possible. And given the number of synonyms there are in the English language, an enormous range of verbal descriptors are possible. However, assessments that are closely aligned with state-mandated standards (which are, themselves, often based on <em>Common Core State Standards</em>), tend to be more comparable. Many SBG systems use verbal descriptors, points, or letters to indicate the learner&#39;s progress relative to specific criteria. Schools that need to make their numerical or letter grade systems conform with mandated verbal descriptors typically establish guidelines for making the conversions. Table 11.3 shows one example.</p>

	<p class="txt">Still, most of the assessment that teachers carry out during a school year will be of their own choosing.

       </ul>

	<p class="txt">Some of these questions, as noted earlier, are answered very clearly by school jurisdictions. Of these, the last four are most likely to be answered by school policy&#8212;although the policy regarding giving out zeros is not always spelled out. This section summarize some of the research relating to this question.</p>
	</div>

<a id="p451"></a>
	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Should I Give Zeros?</h2>
	<div class="single-column"> 
    <p class="txt">It is uncertain how many schools have adopted a formal <strong>no-zero policy</strong>, but the number seems to have been large enough to give rise to a mild controversy. A no-zero policy specifies that zeros are not to be given for failed exams or missed assignments. In some cases teachers are encouraged to replace the zeros with verbal descriptors such as <em>incomplete</em> or shorthand descriptors meaning much the same thing (e.g., NHI, meaning &quot;not handed in,&quot; or ME, meaning &quot;missed exam&quot;).</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Arguments Against a No-Zero Policy</h3>
    <p class="key-point">Like all controversies, the no-zero policy debate has at least two sides. The side that favors zeros claims that in this dog-eat-dog world, you put up or you lose.</p>

	<p class="txt">This side insists that letting students off the hook when they miss examinations or fail to hand in assignments is not doing them any favors&#8212;and in fact that doing so sets them up for failure in the real world. Not giving zeros when a zero is fully warranted is absurd, this side claims.</p>

	<p class="txt">In an extreme situation, such a policy could lead to a student who has not handed in an assignment receiving a higher mark than one who has. This would be the case if the missed assignment is omitted entirely in calculating the final grade. As Zwaagstra (2012) points out, an electrician who doesn&#39;t wire a house and a journalist who doesn&#39;t hand in a story do not get paid. Perhaps a student who doesn&#39;t hand in an assignment should not get &quot;paid&quot; either.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Arguments for a No-Zero Policy</h3>
    <p class="key-point">The other side of the debate is supported by those who believe that giving students zeros may be detrimental to their self-esteem.</p>

	<p class="txt">Besides, they argue, zeros do not reflect what students have learned and accomplished. Furthermore, as O&#39;Connor (2018) suggests, receiving zeros may cause some students to give up and disengage from learning. There appears to be little research to support these arguments other than an older study dealing with the possibly negative effect of zeros on six learning-disabled students in a regular classroom (Selby &#38; Murphy, 1992).</p>

	<p class="txt">Still, there is a more practical reason why it might be wise to avoid zeros: As Norrell (2015) points out, they simply have too much of an effect on final grades.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Because a zero is generally so far away from what would otherwise be the mean, it tends to lower the mean markedly.</p>

	<p class="txt">As a result, a zero becomes a form of punishment for the offending student. Table 11.4 illustrates the effect of a single zero on a student&#39;s GPA. With only one missed assignment, Jada ends up with a mean GPA of 50. This mark, on the 5-point scale shown in Figure 11.7, barely qualifies for a B. On that same scale, Ramzi&#39;s mark would convert to an A&#8211;.</p>

	<a id="p452"></a>
	<p class="txt">However, using the median rather than the mean to calculate grade point score eliminates the effect of the zero in this example. The median of each distribution is identical at the A&ndash; level. But using the median might be highly unfair to Ramzi. He has dutifully handed in all his assignments, but he ends up with the very same mark as Jada even though she didn&#39;t complete the most difficult of the five assignments, knowing there would be no consequence.</p>

	<p class="txt">Excluding Jada&#39;s zero in calculating a final grade also eliminates its effect on the mean. Without the zero, Jada&#39;s mean GPA would be 63&#8212;which hardly seems fair to Ramzi!</p>

	<p class="txt">The issue of zeros versus no zeros has still not been resolved, with many jurisdictions permitting them, others forbidding their use, and still others changing their minds. For example, the English School District of Newfoundland Labrador, which had apparently had a no-zero policy for a number of years, recently announced that &quot;teachers are once again free to deduct marks for late work and assign marks of zero when work doesn&#39;t come in at all&quot; (Zwaagstra, 2017).</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Should I Use Grades to Recommend Grade Retention?</h2>
	<div class="single-column"> 
	<p class="txt">Summative assessments are sometimes one of the bases for student <strong>grade retention</strong>. (Grade retention is today&#39;s more politically correct expression for what was once called <em>flunking</em>.) But these decisions are seldom solely the classroom teacher&#39;s responsibility. In fact, in some jurisdictions, a <strong>no-fail policy</strong> is in effect. Sometimes, as in India, it is even mandated by law: The Indian Right to Education Act stipulates that no child can be held back in a grade before completing elementary school. As a result, there is free passage from grades 1 through 8 (Variyar, 2012).</p>

	<p class="txt">Like the no-zero policy, the no-fail policy is highly controversial. In the absence of the possibility of failure in this Indian system, some argue, students become lazy and unmotivated. They take education lightly, miss school, and suffer little from test anxiety&#8212;until they reach ninth grade. But by then, their background knowledge and study skills are inadequate to cope with the more advanced academic demands of high school. As a result, many students who receive automatic passes through elementary school end up failing and repeating ninth grade (Variyar, 2012).</p>

<a id="p453"></a>
	<p class="txt">Not surprisingly, given how controversial the no-fail policy is, some parents in India have been lobbying the government to reverse the policy (Maadhyam, 2017). However, a 10-year analysis of grade 1&#8211;8 achievement showed no evidence of lower achievement after eighth grade (Scroll.in, 2018).</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Social Promotions and No-Fail Policies</h3>
    <p class="txt">Many North American jurisdictions have an unofficial, rather than mandated, no-fail policy. Many schools, as a matter of general policy, promote all students, especially in the elementary grades&#8212;a process often labeled <strong>social promotion</strong>. In many school districts, the emphasis is on finding educational interventions for remediation rather than on retaining students in a grade. That is, assessment is used to differentiate among students with a view to providing each with the most favorable educational experiences possible&#8212;a process that defines differentiated instruction.</p>

	<p class="txt">Students are most likely to be retained at the level of kindergarten or first grade. However, in many cases children who might otherwise have been candidates for grade retention are simply held back for a year before starting school. This process is sometimes referred to as <strong>academic redshirting</strong> (Range, Dougan, &#38; Pijanowski, 2011). <em>Redshirting</em> is a common expression in sports, in which players who are not quite ready to play with the team are traditionally given different-colored shirts (often red) and allowed to practice and attend coaching sessions. But during the games, they sit on the bench rather than play. The expectation is that next year, they will be full-fledged team members.</p>

	<h3 class="h3">Frequency of and Rationale for Grade Retention</h3>

	<p class="txt">Despite academic redshirting, social promotions, and informal no-fail policies, the National Center for Education Statistics (2010) reports that about 11&#37; of all students are retained at least once between kindergarten and 12th grade. As recently as 2012, in the Los Angeles Unified School District, which includes roughly 11&#37; of all of California&#39;s students, a full 7.5&#37; of students were retained before the third grade (Cannon &#38; Lipscomb, 2011). Recently, however, retention rates have dropped dramatically, and grade 12 graduation rates have increased from 60&#37; in 2011 to 80&#37; in 2015 (Callister, 2014; Hansen, 2017). Nationwide, approximately 10&#37; of learners are retained at least once before 12th grade. Of these, the vast majority are held back in kindergarten or first grade, or again in eighth grade (see Figure 11.8).</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The rationale for retention is often based on one or more of the following beliefs.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Learning problems are often due to immaturity, and repeating a grade will provide time for maturation and lead to better performance.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Social promotions lead to classes that have such a wide range of ability and performance that teaching becomes very difficult.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Allowing social promotions is unfair to the better students.</li>
          <li class="li_text">A no-fail policy leads students to take education lightly and to develop poor study habits.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Grade retention is beneficial for learners.</li>
       </ul>

	<h3 class="h3">Research on the Effects of Grade Retention</h3>

	<p class="key-point">Most of the research does not support the belief that grade retention has beneficial effects or that social promotions lead to more negative outcomes than retention does.</p>

    <p class="txt">For example, a study of 538 first-grade students in a Texas school found that students who had been retained in first grade were 68&#37; more likely to drop out of school than were students who had not been retained. In this study, both the retained and the nonretained groups were evenly matched on a wide variety of relevant variables (Hughes, Cao, West, Smith, &#38; Cerda, 2017). In this connection, it is significant that research indicates that kindergarten attendance is associated with significant reductions in grade retention (e.g., McCoy et al., 2017).</p>

<a id="p455"></a>
	<p class="txt">Similarly, Hughes, West, Kim, and Bauer (2017) looked at the long-term effects of retention in grades 1&#8211;5. They found that retention led to a dramatically increased probability of dropping out of high school.</p>
   
    <p class="txt">One of the reasons sometimes given for retaining children in first grade relates to perceived social immaturity of the child. The hope is that retention will help the child mature and make adjustment to succeeding grades easier. Interestingly, however, it appears that children who are considered delayed in terms of psychosocial adjustment when they are retained in first grade continue to be assessed as lower in social and school competence in later grades, relative to nonretained students (e.g., Anastasiou, Papachristou, &#38; Diakidoy, 2017).</p>
	
    <p class="key-point">In general, the research is remarkably consistent in concluding that promotions are usually a better option than grade retention.</p>

	<p class="txt">The evidence is that students who are retained in a grade are significantly more likely to have negative self-concepts, perform poorly academically, engage in maladaptive behaviors, and be absent from school. An analysis of 21 studies that compared highly similar students, except that some were retained and others promoted, looked at a simple question: Does retention help struggling learners? The answer? No; 18 of the 21 studies indicated that grade retention has neutral effects at best, but more often it has negative effects. And evidence that it might have beneficial effects is almost nonexistent (Marsico Institute for Early Learning and Literacy, 2012).</p>

	<p class="txt">Despite these findings, grade retention remains relatively common, as Figure 11.8 shows.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Should I Grade on the Curve?</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt">Recall the Benjamin Bloom quotation that opened Chapter 10: &quot;The normal curve is a distribution most appropriate to chance and random activity,&quot; said Bloom, who then went on to explain that if we teachers were any good at what we do, our students&#39; achievements would not reflect a chance or random distribution.</p>

    <p class="txt">Yet the fact is that if you have enough students and your assessment instruments are well constructed, marks will approximate a normal distribution. That is much less likely to be the case, however, if you have only a small number of students or if your instruments are poorly constructed. For example, you might design a test on which a horde of your students will have inordinately low scores but a cluster of your really bright students will be able to answer almost all questions accurately. One way of doing this is simply to overload the test with items that require a level of understanding or a skill of such complexity that only the most capable students have any hope of answering correctly.</p>

<a id="p456"></a>	
    <p class="txt">Alternately, some tests consist of items that are so uniformly easy or difficult that most students earn shockingly low or amazingly high scores. In either case there may be too little variation for the marks to show any distribution (see Figure 11.9).</p>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt"><strong>Grading on the curve</strong> is what happens when teachers alter test scores or grades to make them conform to something resembling a normal distribution. Some institutions encourage grading on the curve by indicating the percentage of students who are expected to receive different categories of marks. This is especially true at the postsecondary level, but it also occurs in secondary and sometimes even elementary schools. And as we saw, standardized tests are almost invariably normed so that their score distributions in a large population are close to normal. As a result, when these tests are administered to entire school systems, the scores will likely reflect a normal distribution.</p>

	<p class="txt">Trying to fit the marks of individual classes to a normal distribution is often problematic. In the first place, such a distribution is clearly inappropriate when the class consists of extraordinarily high (or shockingly low) achievers. It fails to take important group differences into account.</p>

    <p class="txt">Second, if all teachers in a school use identical guidelines for approximating a normal curve, then all classes will receive very similar grades no matter how different actual class achievements might be or how gifted&#8212;or inept&#8212;the teacher.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">Also, grading on the curve assumes that assessment instruments are valid and reliable measures. If educators don&#39;t really know what they are measuring (lack of validity), or if the measures they come up with are highly inconsistent (lack of reliability), making them fit a normal curve is meaningless.</p>

<a id="p457"></a>
	<p class="key-point">Grading on the curve is almost always inadvisable for small classes. However, for larger classes, and sometimes to facilitate comparisons with other classes or other schools, a normal curve approximation can be useful.</p>
	
    <p class="txt">If, for example, your institution suggests that a certain percentage of students should receive As, Bs, Cs, and so on, you have a ready guide to help you understand the meaning of your test results. It makes no difference whether your test consists of 79 items, 100 items, or 167 items; nor does it really matter whether the highest achievers answered 60&#37; or 80&#37; or even 100&#37; of the items correctly. As long as the test separates learners along a continuum, you can pull out a previously determined percentage from the top end of the distribution and give them all As, give the next group Bs, and so on. An example of a guide that might be used for this purpose is shown in Table 11.5.</p>

	<p class="txt">If you were to plot the percentages shown in Table 11.5, the resulting graph would bear only a vague resemblance to the normal curve. A normal curve is perfectly symmetrical, so that matching it exactly means there would be as many Fs as As. Few school systems expect, or want, as many learners in the lowest category as in the highest.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Should I Give Credit for Effort, Improvement, and Participation?</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">Particularly in the lower grades, it is often tempting to reward students who have to work really hard to get the same grades as others whose use of their cognitive tools is more elegant and more effective. Similarly, some teachers think that those who improve the most, even if their achievement still lags behind that of those who started further ahead, should be given credit for improvement. And some like to reward those who are most involved in classroom activities and discussions and who participate enthusiastically in school affairs.</p>

	<p class="txt">Research does not provide very clear answers for questions having to do with whether, how, and how often effort, participation, and improvement should be rewarded. Although it is clear that these should be rewarded, should they warrant additional marks and higher grades?</p>

<a id="p458"></a>
	<p class="key-point">Some educators caution that rewarding effort, participation, and improvement may be unrealistic and misleading.</p>

	<p class="txt">Out in the real world, they claim, the important issue is not effort but rather achievement and quality of performance. Too much emphasis on rewarding effort may give learners the idea that, as long as they tried their best, it doesn&#39;t matter that they have learned nothing. Interestingly, most students tend to believe that reward for effort, in the form of higher grades, should be approximately equal to that given for achievement (Tippin, Lafreniere, &#38; Page, 2012).</p>

	<p class="txt">Should teachers reward participation, punctuality, and good manners? Many educators, particularly those who have converted to a standards-based approach to teaching and assessment, think not. They ask: If it isn&#39;t a learning objective, why should it be rewarded? Fortunately, there are many ways of rewarding effort, participation, punctuality, and gentle behaviors that do not involve grades. Sometimes a teacher&#39;s smile is enough.</p>

	<p class="txt">Research suggests that many teachers do take effort, participation, and other similar factors into account when they assign grades (Cox, 2011). This is especially true in the lower grades, in which verbal descriptors such as <em>great improvement</em> or much better or participates well in class are common&#8212;as is a pat on the head or a little star on the work sheet. It is also true in subjects such as physical education, music, or drama, in which students are often rewarded for trying hard. And it is true for learners for whom achievement-related expectations are lower. As noted, using uniform grading criteria for all students is incompatible with current emphases on differentiating formative assessment and instruction so that all learners benefit to their maximum potential.</p>

	<p class="key-point">Giving credit for participation, effort, and improvement provides useful information about the student&#39;s ability to negotiate the nonacademic aspects of schools&#8212;which is an important part of successful, adaptive intelligence.</p>

	<p class="txt">Grades sometimes have better predictive validity for educational success than standardized tests; this may well be due precisely to the fact that teacher grades often take into account nonacademic, school-navigation skills in addition to specific knowledge and subject-related skills. These school-navigation skills are evident in factors such as effort, improvement, and participation. As a result, teacher grades that take these into account reflect individual differences that are predictive of success in life (Thorsen &#38; Cliffordson, 2012).</p>

	<p class="key-point">Teachers should be wary of deducting marks for failing to participate, cautions White (2011).</p>

	<p class="txt">Punishing students who do not take part in class activities assumes that failure to do so is a mark of lack of interest, lack of knowledge or ideas, lack of skills, or disrespect for the teacher and the subject. But that isn&#39;t necessarily the case: Failure to participate might indicate social inclinations associated with timidity; it might also reflect language problems or ethnic and cultural differences (White, 2011). All of these are excellent reasons to use differentiated instruction and grading.</p>

	<p class="txt">Moreover, teachers who reward students for participation, effort, and improvement are, by that very act, providing learners with fundamentally important information about how positive outcomes can result from effort and determination.</p>

<a id="p459"></a>
	<p class="key-point">In effect, what they are telling students is that their efforts are important.</p>

	<p class="txt">As Dweck (2006) points out, learners who believe that they can become more competent and more capable of increasingly difficult challenges are those who have developed a <em>growth mindset</em>. Those who have discovered that their efforts seem to make no difference are more likely to develop <em>fixed mindsets</em>. As we saw earlier, growth mindsets are clearly linked with academic and personal success; fixed mindsets are more often associated with feelings of helplessness and with failure.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Should I Use Differentiated Grading?</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
    <p class="txt">Under certain circumstances, fair grading requires giving credit for effort, improvement, and participation. Some students are unable to achieve at the same level as others. Sometimes this might be due to specific problems, such as learning disabilities or language problems; or it might occur for unknown reasons. In such cases it is often unfair to use the same marking and grading criteria for all students. When this is the case, <strong>differentiated grading</strong> is indicated. Quite simply, differentiated grading means that the teacher does not apply the same grading criteria or the same grading system to all learners.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Am I Contributing to Grade Inflation?</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">In many educational institutions, there is a tendency for grades to increase over time even when there has been no increase in educational standards or in actual performance relative to standards. This situation is defined as <strong>grade inflation</strong>. What happens is that a piece of work handed in one year is worth, say, 75 points, and the same piece of work handed in 10 years later is now worth 80 points. Rojstaczer and Healy&#39;s (2010) examination of grading information from 80 different schools spanning almost a century indicates that grade inflation is a real phenomenon found in many American schools. In particular, they observed a sharp increase in grades from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s.</p>

<a id="p460"></a>
	<p class="txt">More recent research indicates that the grade-inflation trend has not abated and that it appears to be a worldwide phenomenon. For example, Bachan (2017) reports that there is convincing evidence of continuing grade inflation in postsecondary institutions in the United Kingdom since 2009. Grades and the number of <em>honors</em> degrees granted have continued to increase even after controlling for improved university efficiencies and student characteristics.</p>

	<p class="txt">Similarly, when Neves, Ferraz, and Nata (2016) examined large databases of scores at the upper secondary level, they found striking evidence of grade inflation clearly apparent in a dramatic increase in number of students qualifying for access to higher education. And a study that looked at average GPA scores in American postsecondary institutions found noticeable grade inflation in even as short a period as the several years since the mid-1990s (Kostal, Kuncel, &#38; Sackett, 2016). In their words: &quot;Two students with the same academic credentials, same demographic characteristics, and similar course-taking patterns would be expected to obtain cumulative GPAs differing by.079 grade points simply due to having entered college at different times&quot; (p. 17).</p>

	<p class="txt">The reasons given for the fact that grades have tended to inflate over time include the following.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">A type of consumerism, whereby students as consumers rather than scholars seek out professors and teachers who are easy graders. This consumerism is also linked with easy withdrawals and transfers, which allow students to withdraw from classes in which they fear getting low grades and transfer to others in which higher grades are likely.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Student evaluations of teachers and professors, very often posted online. As a result, these evaluations might have serious implications for tenure, for hiring and firing decisions, and for the teacher&#39;s self-concept and emotional well-being. Interestingly, there is a significant positive correlation between students&#39; final grades and their evaluations of the teacher (Chen, Wang, &#38; Yang, 2017). In this connection, it is also revealing to note that students taught by untenured professors have significantly higher GPAs than those taught by tenured professors (Kirk &#38; Spector, 2009).</li>
			<li class="li_text">Self-concept issues; teachers are concerned about making students feel bad.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Teachers&#39; self-esteem issues; low grades might be interpreted to mean ineffective teaching.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Fiscal policies linking funding to enrollment.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Low educational standards and lax adherence to them, with teachers and professors handing out high grades increasingly freely.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Lack of guidelines limiting the number of As awarded.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Lack of national or statewide consistency in grading.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Administrative pressures, sometimes associated with high-stakes testing programs, which tend to encourage schools to inflate grades and which sometimes lead to teaching to the test (Schutz, Drake, Lessner, &#38; Hughes, 2015).</li>
			<li class="li_text">School policies that mandate against low grades, sometimes even stipulating that no student will be given a mark lower than, say, 50&#37;.</li>
			<li class="li_text">No-failure policies that guarantee passing grades even for the poorest imaginable performances.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Contributions to grade inflation from private and charter schools that tend to give out higher grades and fail fewer learners (Neves et al., 2016).</li>
			<li class="li_text">Pressures from parents, students, administrators, or even politicians.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Competition against other schools that appear to hand out higher grades.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Increased teacher accountability and fear of job loss.</li>
            <li class="li_text">An increase in granting special privileges, often in the form of higher grades, to certain students such as athletes (Fuller, Lawrence, Harrison, Eyanson, &#38; Osika, 2017).</li>
     </ul>

<a id="p461"></a>
	<p class="key-point">Campbell (2012) argues that grades need to reflect what students know and are able to do.</p>

	<p class="txt">Grade inflation is unfair to students who normally get high grades, and it is harmful to students who are not rewarded in relation to their efforts and accomplishments but who learn to expect the grade they want rather than one they deserve. Also, grade inflation makes it increasingly difficult to identify those who are outstandingly gifted or talented when more and more students get the highest possible marks. And it is unfair to students who are in schools where grades are not inflated but who must compete with students from schools where grading is more generous. Nevertheless, for learners with special needs, inflating grades and using more positive descriptors may often be justified.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">How Should I Calculate a Final Grade?</h2>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">The question of how to calculate a final grade is relatively unlikely to be a concern for those who use an SBG system in which the final grade might simply take the form of saying, &quot;Yes, Addie has demonstrated mastery of all second-grade arithmetic standards!&quot; However, it is an issue for most traditional grading systems, in which there is no single, simple answer for the question.</p>

	<p class="key-point">The easiest approach is to use a uniform marking system for all exercises, assignments, quizzes, tests, and performances that contribute to the final grade, and to weight these marks equally in arriving at an average, summative grade.</p>

	<p class="txt">An example of this approach is shown in Table 11.6. The inclusion of <em>participation</em> as a category implies that behaviors associated with participation are among the learning goals. Presumably, assignments and quizzes are also aligned with those goals.</p>

	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">In Table 11.6, average percentages are converted to letter grades using the relatively common conversion table shown in Table 11.3. Some schools prefer to report grades as percentages. These give the impression of allowing for finer discriminations. In the example shown in Table 11.6, instead of Malik and Trinity both receiving Bs, Trinity would receive a mark that is apparently 9 points higher. Others argue that, given the imprecision of much of our educational assessment, this distinction is misleading.</p>

<a id="p462"></a>
	<p class="key-point">Another approach to calculating grades involves assigning different weights to different types of marks that contribute to the final score.</p>

	<p class="txt">For example, a teacher might decide that quizzes are worth more than assignments, a major assignment is worth more than a minor one, class participation is worth half as much as a quiz, and the final test is worth half the final grade.</p>

	<p class="txt">The weightings assigned to the various assessment components that make up grades should reflect instructional objectives. If class participation, completing assignments on time, and mastering all weekly quizzes are important objectives, they should be weighted accordingly.</p>

	<p class="txt">Many weighting systems of varying complexity are possible. A relatively simple one is illustrated in Table 11.7. Note that even with a simple system, when different components are assigned different weightings, calculations can be tedious and time consuming, especially for larger classes. However, even with the most complex systems, grades can usually be determined quickly, easily, and accurately using any spreadsheet program. Also, many web-based programs, a number of which are free, are available for setting up grade books that provide ready-made spreadsheet templates with easily adapted formulas (e.g., iSpring, 2017; eLearning Industry, 2018).</p>

  <div class="section-body">

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Grading and preparing report cards is one of the teacher&#39;s most important tasks, one that can have tremendous implications for student success and happiness. Not surprisingly, as Im, Oh, and Suk (2017) report, there appears to be a significant correlation between low grades and symptoms of depression such as suicidal ideation.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="inner-section">
	<h2 class="h2">Types of Report Cards</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Most often, grades summarized in report cards take one or more of three different forms:</p>

	<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">written, verbal descriptors</li>
          <li class="li_text">percentages or other numerical indicators</li>
          <li class="li_text">letter grades</li>
        </ol>

	<p class="txt">As we saw earlier, many school systems use variations or combinations of these systems. And some use entirely different systems, often in the form of four-point, five-point, or nine-point systems.</p>

    <p class="txt"><strong>Report cards</strong> might be printed, hard-copy forms filled out by hand or by computer. Or, in an increasing number of cases, they might be made available online in the form of <strong>e-report cards</strong>. E-report cards are typically accessed by means of a password and user identification. Web-based report cards, as opposed to report cards that are simply made available online, have now become common.</p>

    <p class="key-point">Although giving out report cards is traditionally a course-, term-, or year-end occurrence, it also frequently occurs during a school term or year.</p>

	<p class="txt">In some cases simple report cards might even be a daily occurrence. This might happen, for example, when children with learning difficulties have been placed in special programs. Daily report cards, which are often electronic, serve to inform both child and parents about dayto- day learning or behavior problems (Moore, Whittaker, &#38; Ford, 2016). They are especially useful for monitoring progress and determining interventions in differentiated instructional programs (Miller, Crovello, &#38; Chafouleas, 2017). Therefore, they can be an important formative assessment tool.</p>

	</div>

<a id="p464"></a>
	<h2 class="h2">Information Found on Report Cards</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">Report cards can contain a wide variety of information, including but not limited to grades, behavior, effort, extracurricular activities, and learning objectives. The nature and extent of the information included varies from one school to another; it also reflects whether the school uses an SBG system or a more traditional system.</p>
        
	<p class="txt">The nature of report card information also varies depending on the grade involved. For example, in kindergarten and early grades, verbal descriptors are far more common than numerical summations. What is included in the report might also depend on whether the report is year-end or whether it is one of several <strong>progress report cards</strong> that might be given out during the year.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">As an example, a multipage kindergarten report card used by one school division provides verbal descriptions relating to citizenship and social responsibility, with items such as <em>respect</em>, <em>integrity</em>, <em>empathy</em>, <em>cooperation</em>, <em>independence</em>, and <em>self-control</em> (Parkland School Division, 2017). Another part of the report card deals with early literacy and includes <em>prereading</em> and <em>prewriting</em> skills, <em>listening</em> and <em>speaking</em> skills, and <em>viewing</em> and <em>representing</em> skills. Another looks at the development of number-related concepts. Other pages deal with notions of citizenship and personal identity, with environmental and community awareness, with physical skills and well-being, and with creative expression. The report card also provides room for teacher comments in three areas:</p>
        
		<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">areas of strength</li>
          <li class="li_text">areas for growth</li>

	<p class="txt">Report cards that use only verbal descriptors, such as that shown in Figure 11.10, have become increasingly common in elementary schools. These kinds of report cards are especially useful for describing student behavior relative to standards. However, they provide relatively little information that might be useful for comparing students with each other.</p>

	<p class="txt">A related approach to report cards uses detailed teacher comments. These illustrate what is sometimes labeled a <strong>narrative report card</strong>. Narrative report cards might include a huge variety of comments, such as the following.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Henry is an enthusiastic learner who enjoys school.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Zara uses good judgment in solving science problems.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Juanita is intent on doing her best and always works hard.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Sanjay is a very mature boy.</li>
       </ul>

	<p class="txt">Many report cards, especially in the early grades, include narrative elements in addition to numerical or verbal descriptors. Some narrative comments, like the four examples listed here, are mainly positive. Note that each of these positive statements can be slightly modified to indicate a need for improvement.</p>
	
	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Henry will learn to enjoy school.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Zara will learn to use better judgment in solving her science problems.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Juanita needs to work a little harder.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Sanjay will mature as he gets older.</li>
       </ul>

	<p class="txt">Writing narrative report cards can be a very time-consuming task that can be made somewhat simpler by using various online resources such as the Education World list of 100 positive report card comments dealing with 10 different categories, including attitude, behavior, character, and work habits (Education World, 2018).</p>

<a id="p466"></a>
	<p class="txt">At the high school level and in colleges and universities, numerical and letter grade reporting systems are common. A report card of this nature might be a single-page, letter grade report card that also includes information relative to study habits, school attendance, courtesy, behavior, and lateness. A similar report card could also be used to report numerical rather than letter grades.</p>

	<p class="txt">E-report cards can take the form of any printed report card. They can also contain a wide variety of information in addition to the grades and brief teacher remarks normally found on a hard-copy report card. For example, they can easily include material such as might be found in a student portfolio, information about participation in extracurricular activities, and so on. A huge variety of very useful electronic report card templates are available. Many of these are free or are provided by local school districts. They can vastly simplify the teacher&#39;s work.</p>

	<p class="txt">In most schools, both electronic and hard-copy report cards are usually accompanied by parent&#8211;teacher conferences.</p>

  <p class="intro">In the very beginning, Oog and Ugh, two of our earliest ancestors, had little use for teachers.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section-body">
	<div class="single-column">
	  <p class="txt">What children of those rocky times needed to learn, their parents would surely teach them&#8212;things like which berries are likely to give you a bellyache and that you should pluck the feathers off birds before you eat them. But eventually, someone figured out how to scratch letters on rocks, and someone else invented ways of scribbling messages on tree bark and goatskins.</p>

      </figure>
	
	<div class="single-column">
	  <p class="txt">By the time Oog and Ugh had invented the wheel, the alphabet, and the number system, they had become so busy they no longer had time to teach their kids anything other than the basic stuff you learn in the cave or the hut. So they hired a teacher. And when they hired this teacher, they said, speaking Latin of course, &quot;You will be paid to act in loco parentis.&quot; Which does not mean acting like one of those crazy parents!</p>

      <p class="txt">Translated literally, <em><strong>in loco parentis</strong></em> means &quot;in the place of a parent.&quot; This phrase still describes the role of today&#39;s teacher. In essence, it means that the teacher, in all practical ways, will act toward the student as might a wise, loving, intelligent, well-educated, and concerned parent.</p>

	  <p class="txt">And, understandably, parents and guardians need ongoing assurance that teachers are in fact fulfilling the heavy responsibilities placed on them. Providing that assurance is one of the purposes of <strong>parent&#8211;teacher conferences&#8212;</strong>those regularly scheduled, formal meetings between the student&#39;s caregivers and the student&#39;s teachers (see <em>In the Classroom: Helicopter and Snowplow Parents</em>).</p>

      <div class="box-6">
        <h3 class="h3">In the Classroom: Helicopter and Snowplow Parents</h3>
        <p class="txt">Much has been written in recent years about <strong>helicopter parents</strong>, who pay an inordinate amount of attention to their child&#39;s experiences (e.g., Frey &#38; Tatum, 2016; Hind, 2017). Helicopter parents are especially concerned with their children&#39;s school experiences. They hover over teachers; they want to know what is being taught and why; they want details of grading systems and explanations and justifications for their children&#39;s grades. Helicopter parents can make teachers&#39; lives far more difficult than they once were.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Case in point: A few years ago, in a small town outside Edmonton, Canada, more than 150 concerned (helicopter?) parents and their children marched to the Battle River School District offices to protest a new, not especially simple, grading system (Sands, 2013). It assigns verbal descriptors corresponding to percentages: Below 50&#37; is <em>beginning</em>; 50&#37; to 66&#37; is <em>developing</em>; 67&#37; to 83&#37; is <em>achieving</em>; and above 83&#37; is <em>excelling</em>. These descriptors are then entered into the district computing system as number grades&#8212;1, 2, 3, or 4&#8212;from which the computer calculates a final percentage grade. In addition, the new grading system bans the assignment of zeros.</p>

		<p class="ext">So students and parents protest. <em>NO CONVERTED MARKS JUST RAW PERCENTAGES</em>, their placards insist: <em>ALPHAS GOT TO GO: PERCENTS ARE THE WAY TO GO</em>.</p>
		
		<p class="ext">&quot;I&#39;m humbled by this,&quot; says Rick Jarrett, the assistant superintendent. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of passion here.&quot;</p>

		<p class="ext">Parents&#8212;and their children too&#8212;no longer believe that teachers and school districts always know best. (Sands, 2013, p. A3)</p>

        <p class="txt">And now a new kind of parent has appeared: the <strong>snowplow parent</strong>, sometimes called the <em>lawnmower parent</em> (McCullough, 2014). These are parents who see their children as <em>special</em> and who are determined to do everything within their power to make sure they succeed. They are <em>snowplows</em> (or <em>lawnmowers</em>): They bulldoze and mow down everything that stands in their child&#39;s way. They are committed, explains Wood (2018), to keeping their kids from failure at all costs. They gladly invest huge sums for tutors and special classes to move their offspring ahead of the pack. They buy online preparation materials and practice tests to prepare them for their exit and entrance examinations. They even take over their homework assignments and correct their spelling when doing so might improve their grades. In short, they become such an overwhelming support system that the child grows up knowing that success will always be easy: Parents will plow away all the obstacles.</p>

	    <p class="txt">And if the snowplow breaks down, if it runs into drifts it can&#39;t push aside and the child later fails&#8212;well, the child might not really see failure as a personal event, says McCullough: It&#39;s really a failure of the child&#39;s support system.</p>

		<p class="txt">Step back, says McCullough. Give children some independence.</p>

	<div class="single-column">
	<p class="txt">The purpose of parent&#8211;teacher conferences is not limited to reassuring parents that the teacher is competent. Rather, the conferences underline the collaborative nature of the educational enterprise. Research is clear that engaging the family in children&#39;s education is important for student success. Parents who are most involved in their children&#39;s schools are those whose children are likely to display the highest achievement and the most advanced social skills (Dawson &#38; Wymbs, 2016).</p>

	<p class="key-point">The focus of parent&#8211;teacher conferences, especially in the early grades, is on the parent&#8211;teacher partnership.</p>
	
	<p class="txt">In these conferences teachers are generally seen as experts. Their role is often one of giving advice, answering questions, outlining objectives, explaining assessment and grading systems, and clarifying misconceptions. Interestingly, however, their role can also take the form of collaborating with the parent in an effort to influence the child&#39;s behavior. For example, research reported by Bilton, Jackson, and Hymer (2017) reveals that when the child is present, the informative role of the teacher tends to change: Now, both the teacher and the parent(s) typically join forces, particularly if there appears to be a need to change the child&#39;s conduct or study and work habits.</p>

	<p class="txt">Parent&#8211;teacher conferences offer teachers an important opportunity to provide parents and students with feedback on the student&#39;s work and to make summative comments that are more constructive than critical and that foster the development of a <em>growth mindset</em>. Recall that learners who have a growth mindset are those who view intelligence and their personal capabilities as malleable&#8212;as something that can be improved with effort. In contrast, learners who are characterized by a <em>fixed mindset</em> see intelligence as a stable entity&#8212;something that no amount of effort is likely to improve.</p>

	<p class="txt">Constructive teacher comments that are most likely to foster the development of growth mindsets are those that focus on the positive outcomes of the learner&#39;s efforts, single out improvements, and suggest how the learner&#39;s efforts are linked directly with positive results&#8212;for example, comments such as the following.</p>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Your writing is really improving...</li>
          <li class="li_text">You are much better at math...</li>
          <li class="li_text">Have you noticed how much more quickly you understand...?</li>
          <li class="li_text">How could you help someone else understand this?</li>
          <li class="li_text">I can see you really enjoyed...</li>
          <li class="li_text">Your hard work sure paid off...</li>
          <li class="li_text">It&#39;s amazing how you become better and better...</li>
       </ul>

    <p class="txt">It is very important, from the very beginning, for parents to understand that they, along with teachers and administrators, are part of a team dedicated to the optimal learning and development of their children. So, from day one, parents need to be made fully aware of the school&#39;s goals, of important learning objectives, and of the nature, applications, and meaning of the teacher&#39;s grading practices. Accomplishing this task requires that teachers keep good records. And when meeting with parents, it is often helpful for teachers to have samples of students&#39; work ready to illustrate emphases, needs, accomplishments, and assessments.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="section-lead">
  
   <p class="intro">Darling-Kuria (2012) describes a situation in which a parent comes to a preschool parent&#8211;teacher conference armed with a set of flash cards recently purchased, almost guaranteed to teach this parent&#39;s 18-month-old child how to read. The parent is convinced that if the preschool teacher uses these cards, all the children will quickly learn to read and will later begin school with a tremendous head start.</p>
   
   </div>
  <div class="section-body">
   <div class="single-column">

    <p class="txt">The expectation is clearly unrealistic, but the parent is dead serious&#8212;another <em>snowplow</em> parent, the victim of advertising campaigns that promise to make baby into another Einstein or Mozart in 10 easy steps.</p>

	<p class="txt">Therefore, the teacher&#39;s first task in the conference is to clarify the misconception&#8212;the unrealistic expectation. The second task is to spell out what the learning objectives are for the child and to explain how the parent can play a fundamental and extremely important role in helping the child reach these targets.</p>

	<p class="txt">Unrealistic parental expectations and misunderstandings aren&#39;t uncommon, especially among today&#39;s helicopter and snowplow parents. For instance, teachers often need to clarify and explain discrepancies between measures of aptitude and actual achievement. Figure 11.11 illustrates how these discrepancies can sometimes be interpreted as indicating under- or overachieving.</p>

	<p class="txt"><strong>Underachievement</strong> involves achieving below expectations based on ability. <em>Overachievement</em> signifies the opposite: achieving at a higher level than would be expected. Unfortunately, as we noted in Chapter 6, the term <em>overachievement</em> is sometimes viewed negatively and may be seen as disparaging those whose accomplishments seem to go beyond what others expect of them. Overachieving is literally impossible. To say that someone overachieves is to admit that our estimates of their skills and abilities are not that positive.</p>

	<p class="txt">Tulley&#39;s results on a standardized reading test, as shown in Figure 11.11, might indicate overachievement: He performed at a higher level (50th percentile) than might be expected on the basis of his verbal ability ranking (40th percentile). On the other hand, his score on the mathematics subtest might be evidence of underachievement: He scored at the 65th percentile, whereas his ability measure ranks him at the 70th percentile.</p>

	<p class="txt">Now Tulley&#39;s father, having quickly glanced at these results, suggests that Tulley needs some sort of intervention in mathematics so that his achievement can rise up to his abilities. &quot;He&#39;s underachieving,&quot; says the father. &quot;Can you help him? Should I get him some tutors?&quot;</p>

	<p class="txt">&quot;You&#39;re right,&quot; agrees Tulley&#39;s mother, nodding toward Tulley&#39;s father. &quot;He&#39;s got your talent for numbers. He should be doing a lot better. But,&quot; she adds pointing her finger triumphantly at Tulley&#39;s report card, &quot;I see something more important. His reading score is way low next to his math. He&#39;s got to be given some help so he can do as good in reading as in math.&quot;</p>

	<p class="txt">The teacher can respond to these comments by pointing out three important facts.</p>

	<ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">Tulley is really doing very well in both mathematics and reading. He is achieving at a higher rank than 50&#37; of comparable students in reading and better than 65&#37; in mathematics.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Given that measures of ability&#8212;and of achievement as well&#8212;are subject to a number of different sources of error, they should be looked at as approximations rather than exact values. A difference of 5 between ability and achievement percentile ranks hardly qualifies as proof of under- or over achievement.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Expecting Tulley to achieve at the same level in mathematics as in reading, given apparent differences in underlying abilities, is unrealistic.</li>

	<h2 class="h2">Preparing for Parent&#8211;Teacher Conferences</h2>
	<div class="single-column">
    <p class="txt">Ideally, parent&#8211;teacher conferences should be positive, friendly, help-giving, relaxed sessions, free of time constraints and focused on constructive feedback designed to foster the development of <em>growth mindsets</em>. In practice, this is not always the case. Parent&#8211;teacher conferences can be tense affairs in which one or both parties become defensive or aggressive, and proceedings can be hurried by the need to see 14 parents in one evening. It is never good for the teacher to say, &quot;If your kid doesn&#39;t see a behavior psychologist, I just might have to retire.&quot; Or, &quot;Your kid is the only one in class who can&#39;t count to 100 yet.&quot;</p>

	<p class="txt">Unfortunately, however, the parents about whose children teachers might sometimes be tempted to say such things are often the ones who do not come to parent&#8211;teacher conferences. Not infrequently, these meetings are monopolized by the parents of the A students.</p>

    <p class="txt">The following are some useful guidelines and suggestions for preparing and conducting parent&#8211; teacher conferences.</p>
	
	<h3 class="h3">Before the Conference</h3>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Write or e-mail parents, asking them to share information about the child&#39;s interests and activities and to describe the goals and expectations they have for your class.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Whenever possible, schedule appointments to accommodate work and other parental constraints.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Arrange for comfortable seating for parents (first graders&#39; desks and chairs aren&#39;t ideal for most adults).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Prepare achievement records and collect dated samples (portfolios) of student work to show parents.</li>
		  <li class="li_text">Anticipate parents&#39; questions (such as &quot;How do you grade students?&quot; and &quot;What can I do to help Elsie in math?&quot;).</li>
          <li class="li_text">Prepare easily communicated, clear, constructive feedback comments that focus on the child&#39;s efforts and the positive results associated with them.</li>
       </ul>

	<h3 class="h3">During the Conference</h3>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Start on a positive note by saying something nice about the child.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Ask parents to talk about the child.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Try to involve parents in collaborating on goals.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Suggest helpful activities parents can carry out at home.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Provide parents with information about special help, if appropriate.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Answer all questions as completely and honestly as possible.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Schedule the length of the conference according to the needs of the child.</li>
       </ul>
	 
	 <h3 class="h3">After the Conference</h3>

	<ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">Summarize the conference and make notes of important points.</li>
          <li class="li_text">Send a follow-up letter or e-mail to parents.</li>

        <p class="txt">Our schools are becoming more and more diverse. This situation offers wonderful opportunities and exciting possibilities. It also calls for teachers to be much more responsive to the families of the students in their classrooms. Planning for conferences with parents and guardians is not a quick, pull-together-some-student-work event. Knowing the diverse backgrounds of your students&#39; families will help you facilitate meetings that will support student success in your classroom.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">When planning for conferences, it is important to consider three factors that may affect the outcome of the conference: cultural differences, language differences, and power and status.</p>
		
		  <p class="txt"><strong><em>Cultural Differences</em></strong></p>
		<p class="txt">Cultural differences can affect a conference in a number of ways. For example, teachers need to understand the worldviews of the families within their classrooms. They need to ask themselves whether the family holds an individualistic/autonomous viewpoint or a collectivist viewpoint. Those with an individualistic orientation will bring an independent, stand-alone-against-the-world approach to the classroom; those with a more grouporiented view will be more concerned with cooperation and helpfulness. Knowing the family&#39;s worldview&#8212;knowing what the family values&#8212;will help the teacher prepare for the conference.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Cultural differences can also extend to the roles individuals take within the family. Teachers should be aware of who plays the role of decision maker&#8212;father, mother, or both? Who is responsible for developing a child&#39;s social skills? Academic skills? Answers to these questions can help teachers ensure the right people attend the conference.</p>

		  <p class="txt"><strong><em>Language Differences</em></strong></p>
	    <p class="txt">The importance of language differences goes beyond knowing whether the parents or guardians can speak English or whether they will need and accept a translator. Teachers also need to be aware of how the complexities of the English language can be problematic for nonnative speakers. Jargon, idiomatic expressions, and difficult vocabulary can be confusing to those whose primary language is not English. It is important that teachers check often throughout the conference to ensure the parents or guardians understand the intended message.</p>

		  <p class="txt"><strong><em>Power and Status</em></strong></p>
		<p class="txt">Finally, it is important for teachers to know how educators are perceived in the family&#39;s culture. In some cultures, teachers are endowed with enormous power and status: They are seen as experts whose authority is not to be questioned. Such a perspective may be apparent in families who are reluctant to engage in the conference, not wanting to appear to question the teacher&#39;s authority. They may not voice their opinions or even share insights about their child.</p>
		
        <p class="txt">Other families may view teachers as being ineffective and education as being of little value. Parents or guardians who hold this view are less likely to attend scheduled conferences. And if they do, they may be argumentative and dismissive. How a teacher prepares for a conference should reflect the teacher&#39;s knowledge of the power and status families attribute to teachers.</p>

	<h2 class="h2">Student-Led Parent&#8211;Teacher Conferences</h2>
	<div class="single-column">	
	<p class="txt">A relatively new trend in education has students rather than teachers leading parent&#8211;teacher conferences (Cromwell, 2015). In these conferences, students assume the responsibility of introducing parents to their work, explaining their grades, and discussing future directions. Often, students are asked to prepare a presentation, the nature of which is determined by their grade and their skills. For example, younger students might prepare a poster board or a collection of their work to show their parents. Older students might select material from a portfolio or even prepare a computer-based presentation.</p>	
	
	<p class="txt">Typically, student-led conferences are kept brief&#8212;perhaps just 10 minutes or so (Edutopia, 2015). During the session, teachers act as facilitators, answering questions and clarifying information as needed. This approach allows teachers to observe students interacting closely with their parents. Having students try to explain to parents what they are learning can sometimes be highly revealing and can contribute much to the teaching&#8211;learning process.</p>

	<p class="txt">Student-led conferences require careful preparation by the student in collaboration with the teacher. Having students try to understand instructional objectives so that they can communicate them to their parents, and having them assess their performance relative to these objectives, can be important learning experiences for both student and teacher.</p>

	<p class="txt">A great benefit of student-led conferences is the emphasis it places on student accountability. A well-organized and well-run student-led conference requires that the student be accountable for&#8212;at least to the extent of understanding and being able to communicate&#8212;learning objectives, performance relative to objectives, and assessment. Allowing students to lead parent&#8211;teacher conferences might go a long way toward making autonomous, self-regulated learners of them&#8212;of developing them into people who, when they leave our schools, have mastered the art of learning.</p>

	<p class="txt">We can ask little more of our learners.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Standards, Backward Design, and Grading Systems</h3>
      <p class="txt">There is some fear that working for grades undermines intrinsic interest in schooling, encourages students to shop for easy courses, and fosters memorization of facts likely to be tested at the expense of critical and creative thinking. Some teachers try to fight, subvert, or change the system; most accommodate to it. Standards-based grading (SBG) requires establishing clear criteria and assessing each learner in terms of performance relative to these criteria. SBG changes the assessment focus from marks to standards and provides information for formative feedback. Traditional grading systems are often based on marks derived from a combination of rubrics, standards-based assessment, self-assessment, peer assessment, portfolios, and points-based assessments.</p>

<a id="p474"></a>
      <h3 class="h3">Issues in Grading</h3>
      <p class="txt">Recurring issues in grading relate to questions such as: Should I give zeros? (There is no clear answer.) Should I use grades to recommend retention? (Not highly recommended.) Should I grade on the curve? (Often inappropriate unless classes are very large and heterogeneous.) Should I give credit for effort, improvement, and participation? (Debatable. If these are specified in learning standards, perhaps they should be rewarded in other ways.) Should I use differentiated grading? (Sometimes, yes&#8212;for example, for learners with special needs.) Am I contributing to grade inflation? (Try not to.) How should I combine marks to arrive at a final grade? (In any way, or a combination of many different ways.) &quot;It depends&quot; is a reasonable answer for each of these questions.</p>

      <h3 class="h3">Report Cards</h3>
      <p class="txt">Report cards are basically a summation of student achievement that provide different information depending on whether they result from a standards-based or more traditional grading system. Some also contain information about attendance and behavior, instructional objectives, and extracurricular activities. Low grades on report cards can be devastating; high marks, exhilarating. Report card summaries can be verbal descriptors, percentages or other numerical indicators, or letter grades. Increasingly, report cards are electronic summaries based on commercially developed templates. Some are accessed online; others may be printed or even written out and carried, mailed, or e-mailed to parents.</p>

	  <h3 class="h3">Parent&#8211;Teacher Conferences</h3>
      <p class="txt">Teachers and school administrators are charged with acting in loco parentis. Part of that charge requires communication and close collaboration with parents and other caregivers, both of which are facilitated by parent&#8211;teacher conferences. These serve as an occasion for clarifying instructional objectives and helping parents understand how they can support and assist in their child&#39;s learning. It also gives teachers an important opportunity to provide parents and learners with constructive feedback directed toward fostering <em>growth</em> rather than <em>fixed</em> mindsets. Following some simple guidelines can greatly improve their effectiveness. Increasingly popular student-led conferences can have benefits for all parties concerned.</p>
