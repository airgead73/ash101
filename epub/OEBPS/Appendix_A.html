<p class="media">Media not working on mobile? Try opening this eBook on your desktop or laptop computer.</p>
</div>

<p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s begin by identifying some of the main elements of the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word screen. The first thing you notice when you open the program is a big, white, vertical rectangle on a light blue background (depending on your system settings, your screen colors may differ slightly). This is your paper, or <em>Document window</em>, awaiting your brilliant thoughts and ideas! Click in this white box and you will see a small, vertical, black blinking bar; this is your cursor. You can think of the cursor as your insertion point (where you insert text or objects into your document). Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will place the items you type or insert within your document at the cursor (insertion point) location. </p>


<p class="txt">Something important to keep in mind with respect to items that can be added or inserted into a document, spreadsheet, or presentation is this: Anything that falls under the Insert tab in any of the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Office applications&mdash;and especially as it relates to charts, graphics, images, and photos&mdash;is referred to as an &ldquo;object.&rdquo; <em>Objects</em> (once selected by the click of a mouse) can be deleted, moved, and resized at will. Once you have added an object to a document and clicked on the object, consider it activated, meaning that it can be worked with or styled. This is why you will sometimes see additional tabs pop up over the main ribbon with features that allow you to work with the particular object selected. You will see examples of this as you work through some of the elements of this tutorial. </p>


<p class="txt">A note about resizing objects within a Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word document or PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> presentation: Do not grab the sides of the object with the mouse and drag any which way. Instead, resize an object by grabbing at the corners of it with the mouse and expanding or shrinking it diagonally. This practice keeps the height and width settings in the proper ratio and prevents the object from getting distorted. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Your First Document </h2>


<p class="txt">As we explore Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word, it would be helpful to launch the application and open up a new blank document. First, you need to find Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word on your computer. Typically, you will see an <em>icon</em> on the desktop that acts as a <em>shortcut</em> to Microsoft&reg; Word (just double-click it), or you can click on the Windows<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Start button in the lower left-hand side of your screen and look for a Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word icon in that menu. Another option is to click on the All Programs menu item right above the Windows<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Start button when you click on it. Finally, if all that fails, click on the Windows<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Start button again, and in the window where it says &ldquo;Search programs and files,&rdquo; type in &ldquo;Word&rdquo; or &ldquo;Winword.&rdquo; This will search your system and launch Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word. </p>

<a id="p230"></a>

<p class="txt">When Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word launches, you can select File, then New Blank Document, and finally click Create. This will launch a new blank document window. </p>




<h2 class="h2">The Ruler and Margins </h2>


<p class="txt">Just above the document window horizontally and also to the left of your paper vertically is what looks like a <em>ruler </em>that is divided into numbered inches (the smallest marks are at &#8539;-inch intervals). If you do not see a ruler in your document window, click on the View tab at the top of your screen, and then check the box Ruler to make the rulers appear. A standard piece of paper is 8.5 inches from left to right and 11 inches from top to bottom. The Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word ruler guides show you exactly where you are typing on this standard-sized paper. The rulers can also be used to set your <em>margins</em>, which define where you can and cannot type on your paper. On the top ruler guide, you will notice that roughly the first inch is lightly shaded. This is your leftmost margin. Everything in white is your active paper where you can type. The rightmost margin is the shaded section at the end of the ruler. This is an easy way for you to adjust the margins of the paper. Hover your pointer (using your mouse) over it, and it will turn into a left and right arrow. When you click and hold your mouse button, a vertical dotted line will appear. This is your left margin, and you can drag it left or right. You can do the same thing with the right, top, and bottom margins, too. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Zoom </h2>


<p class="txt">At the very bottom of the screen, you will find other important information. On the left, you will see what page number you are currently working on, as well as how many total pages are in your document. To the right of that is a count of the total number of words. Then moving all the way to the bottom right of the screen, you will see a number with a &ldquo;%&rdquo; after it and a minus (-) to plus (+) sliding bar. This is how you <em>zoom</em> in and out of your paper. If you slide it to the right, the percentage of zoom increases, displaying your document at a much more detailed level. It is like moving your face very close to a book in real life. If you want to see it from farther away, slide the bar toward the minus end. There is no correct number here, so experiment with it and see where this zoom is the most comfortable place for you to edit and write in your document. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Ribbons </h2>


<p class="txt">Now let&rsquo;s take a look at the top of your screen, which is where you will find access to Micro-soft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word&rsquo;s powerful features. The top bar is known as the <em>ribbon</em>, which changes when you select any of the eight main tabs or menu options (File, Home, Insert, Page Layout, References, Mailings, Review, and View). </p>


<p class="txt">In many cases, if you simply point your mouse (without clicking) at a particular item shown on the ribbon, you&rsquo;ll see a <em>screen-tip</em> pop up that gives you more information about that item. This can be very useful to you! </p>

<a id="p231"></a>

<p class="txt">Observe that each ribbon is composed of individual tabs. Each tab is then broken down into sections. See that in the lower right-hand corner of some sections, there is a tiny square with an angled arrow pointing down and to the right-hand corner. When you see this, know that there are more options for that particular section. Clicking in that lower right-hand corner will launch a <em>dialog box</em>. </p>


<p class="txt">The dialog box of menu items will open up for that particular section, which allows for greater control over options for that section. You can then talk to, or dialog with, Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word and tell it what specific changes you want to make. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Templates </h2>


<p class="txt">In the upper left corner of your window, you will see the File tab. You will select it to perform some basic Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word functions and also to update your Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word Options. Go ahead and click it, and you will see a list of functions on the left side. One of the most important functions is the New option, which opens up a new document. You can open as many documents at one time as you like. After you select New, you will also see a list of <em>Templates</em>. These are predesigned Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word documents that are ready for you to use. Some of the most popular of these are brochures, calendars, faxes, newsletters, r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, and memos. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Open and Save </h2>


<p class="txt">Again in the File tab or Office button, Open is what you should select if you want to edit an existing document you created earlier. This will normally open up a window in My Documents, where you will see all of your personal files and folders. But if you have opened or saved files from another folder, Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will display that folder instead. In either case, from there you can find the document you want to edit and double-click it, and it will open in Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word. Save is important because it enables you to keep all your hard work safe and lets you access it again in the future with the Open command. Though Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word has an Autosave function, it is also a good idea to manually save your file frequently by clicking the Save button. </p>


<p class="txt">There may be times when you want to save your document to a file with a different name. In such cases, you should select the File menu Save As option. Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word, in turn, will display a dialog box within which you can save the document to a new file name and specify the folder destination that you want to save into. This is important because sometimes you need to work on a copy of the original document and keep a safe, untouched copy available. This is considered a best practice. Open an existing document and immediately use &ldquo;Save As&rdquo; to save the new working copy to a different name, preserving the original. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Print </h2>


<p class="txt">The Print option is also in the File tab. This is what you will select to send your document to a printer. When you select Print, another window opens with several options for you. The first is a drop-down box where you see the default printer and also a list of all other printers you can select on your computer. Then you can define which of the pages you want to print in the Page Range. This includes All for the entire document, Current Page for just the page where your cursor is now, and Pages, which is the option for printing a range of pages. Additionally, to the right of the dialog box with all the print options, you will see your document shown in Print Preview mode. This is how your printed document will look if printed using your selected printer. </p>


<a id="p232"></a>


<h2 class="h2">Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word Options </h2>


<p class="txt">There is one other important button you should know about here. At the bottom of the File tab menu, you will see the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word Options button. Click it, and it will open the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word Options dialog window. There are numerous options to explore here; we will focus only on some of the most important ones. You will access these by selecting the options on the left side of the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word Options box. These include General, Display, Proofing, Save, Advanced, Customize, Add-Ins, Trust Center, and Resources. </p>


<p class="txt">Now let&rsquo;s take a look at a few of the most helpful options in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word to get you started. Display provides ways to change how the document content is displayed on the screen and also how it looks when you print it. Proofing is the place you will go when you want to change how Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word formats and corrects the text you type. It is important to make sure the &ldquo;Check spelling as you type&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Mark grammar errors as you type&rdquo; are checked. When they are selected, Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will underline words and phrases it thinks are grammatically incorrect or misspelled so that you can change them immediately. The Customize option is helpful because it enables you to add commands to the top of the screen and the Quick Access Toolbar. Simply find the commands you use most often, select add, and they will appear for you on this toolbar. </p>


<p class="txt">Finally, the Save option is to let you customize how Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word documents are saved. You should be saving your files in the most recent format. A <em>file format</em> is the way a particular computer application stores its information. If you are in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word and save your file with the name FinalPaper, the program will add to this name an <em>extension</em>, which indicates the file format. The extension in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word 2010 is .docx, and it indicates what program the computer should use to open it. Most older versions of Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word saved files with the .doc extension as the default. You will encounter hundreds of different file extensions as you use different programs. </p>


<p class="txt">As you submit papers for your homework assignments, there may be times when you want or are required to submit a .pdf file (portable document format). PDFs are normally smaller and easier to manage than Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word documents and cannot be edited/changed by another user. To create a PDF file, select the PDF format from within the Save As dialog box. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Quick Access Toolbar </h2>


<p class="txt">In the upper left corner of the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word ribbon is another valuable tool: the Quick Access Toolbar. To try an example of using the <em>Quick Access Toolbar</em>, go ahead and type some sample text onto your paper. We will use this to experiment with. Note that you cannot make a mistake from which you cannot recover, because all Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> products have an Undo and Redo function. The very top bar of the screen is the Quick Access Toolbar, where your most frequent tasks can be placed, and they do not change when you adjust the ribbons. Take a look at some of the icons there now. The first one is an icon of an old 3.5-inch floppy disk, and when you click it, you will save your document. The next icon (a curved arrow pointing left) is the Undo button. Type some text, delete it, and then select the Undo button to see what happens. If you change your mind and really want to keep what you undid, then you can always select the Redo icon (the arrow that is in a counterclockwise circle). Also, by pressing the Ctrl-Z keyboard combination, you can undo your last operation. The real beauty and power of the Quick Access Toolbar is the ability to customize the buttons displayed there. This can be done by clicking on the small icon to the right of the Redo icon that looks like a horizontal line above a downward-pointing arrow. You can then check and uncheck any of the items from the drop-down menu to add or remove them from the Quick Access Toolbar. </p>

</div>


<p class="txt">Now, with the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word basics under your belt, we can proceed to exploring the <em>Home Ribbon</em> tab, which is the default tab selected when you open up Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word. The Home Ribbon tab is important because the most common functions reside here, and this is where you will be spending most of your time in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word. </p>
     




<h2 class="h2">Clipboard </h2>


<p class="txt">If you look at the ribbon, you will note that it is divided into five main sections, which include Clipboard, Font, Paragraph, Styles, and Editing. The <em>Clipboard</em> is for &ldquo;cutting and pasting&rdquo; or &ldquo;copying and pasting.&rdquo; These terms describe what you do when you want to literally copy or cut text or an image from one place and paste it somewhere else. Remember, you never have to retype something to move it. Copy and paste it instead! </p>


<p class="txt">One caution&mdash;while it is possible to move textual content or images from one location in a document to another (same document or a different document) with the mouse, for example, it is considered a best practice to cut the text or image from one location (which then places it on the Clipboard), then paste it in the new location. This is a much safer procedure. Thus, this is the approach we will explore in this tutorial. </p>




<h3 class="h3">Cut and Paste</h3>

<p class="txt">After you type some text on your open Word document, go ahead and highlight a portion of it by clicking and holding the left mouse button and moving it over the text you want to copy. If you want to cut it (the scissor icon), select the scissors, and the text disappears but is not really gone. Alternatively, you could right-click the selected text and choose the word &ldquo;cut&rdquo; again next to the scissor icon, which achieves the same result. The selected text is then copied to the Clipboard. To actually see the text, you will find a very tiny arrow in the Home tab Clipboard group (to the right of the word &ldquo;clipboard&rdquo;) pointing to the bottom right corner. Select it, and a panel on the left will open up that shows the actual Clipboard. Your cut text is displayed there. Now, if you want to paste it to a different part of your document, simply move your cursor to that location and select the large Paste button in the Home tab Clipboard group. Note: The Clipboard can hold many parts of text that are all available for pasting into your document where you so choose. That is, you can have multiple lines of text that you&rsquo;ve cut from a document, lined up and ready to be pasted elsewhere. Understand, too, that the Copy icon in the Home tab Clipboard group works in the same way. However, instead of cutting the selected text from your document, the Copy icon leaves it there and simply puts a copy of the selected text on the Clipboard for you to use elsewhere. </p>


<p class="txt">But suppose for a moment that we do not have ready access to a mouse to perform work with the Clipboard section. No worries! We can use the keyboard to achieve the same result. For example, to perform a cut-and-paste operation, open a Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word document and type the letters A, C, and B, in that order. Then, using your keyboard arrow keys, move the cursor next to the letter C. Hold down the Shift key and move the cursor over the letter C to select it. Then, press the Ctrl-X keyboard combination by holding down the Ctrl key and typing X. </p>

<a id="p234"></a>

<p class="txt">Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will remove the letter C (cutting it) from the document and copy it to the Clipboard. Then move the cursor to the right of the letter B. Press the space bar once and then press the Ctrl-V keyboard combination (holding down the Ctrl key and typing V). Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word will copy (paste) the letter C from the Clipboard back into your document, putting the letters A, B, and C in order. </p>


<p class="txt">A unique situation comes into play when you use the Paste function. Sometimes when you use Paste&mdash;especially if you use the right-click of the mouse to bring up the context-sensitive menu&mdash;you will be met with Paste options. </p>


<p class="txt">Basically, when you copy text from one location, you bring over its formatting as well (things like the font style, size, color, bold, italics, underline, etc.). You can then choose to </p>


<ul class="bl">
<li class="li_text">paste the text in the new location keeping the original formatting from the spot it came from (this would be the first Clipboard option); </li>

<li class="li_text">merge with the formatting of the destination you&rsquo;re sending it to (the second Clipboard option); or </li>

<li class="li_text">strip out the formatting and simply paste just the raw text itself (the third Clipboard option). </li>
</ul>


<p class="txt">This is something you need to be aware of, as it will come up when you use the Paste function throughout Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word. It would be helpful to experiment with this functionality as you go about learning Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word. </p>


<p class="txt">It is important at this point to review that &ldquo;cut&rdquo; and &ldquo;copy&rdquo; are not the same thing. Cut actually removes the selected text from your document and places it on the Clipboard. Copy takes a snapshot of the selected text and places it on the Clipboard, leaving the original text in the document intact. </p>


<p class="txt">In addition to these Clipboard-specific keyboard shortcuts, other shortcuts are also of value. Table A1 summarizes important and useful Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word keyboard shortcut characters. </p>

<h2 class="h2">Font</h2>

<p class="txt">The second area of the Home Ribbon we want to review is the Font section. The word &ldquo;font&rdquo; means the style and size of the text you are using in your document. There are lots of different font styles, and you can combine as many as you like on a page. The default is typically Calibri, but to see all of them, select the drop-down arrow next to Calibri. And to truly experiment, select the text you would like to change in your document, click the drop-down font name menu, and simply move your mouse (without clicking) across and over the individual font names. Watch as your selected text changes to each new font face name&mdash;this feature is called &ldquo;live preview&rdquo; and is a fantastic way to test-drive the look of your document. Live preview works for Microsoft&reg; Word styles and templates as well. Once you’re done with the preview, find the font you like, select it, and you will start typing in this font.</p>


<p class="txt">The font <em>point</em> size determines how large the text is, and the default is the number 12. The larger the number, the bigger the font. For your papers, you should use a 12-point font unless otherwise specified by an instructor. Under these style and size options are important icons. The <strong>B</strong> icon enables you to put text in boldface, the <em>I</em> stands for italics, and the <U>U</U> will let you underline words. You can also change the text color by selecting the down arrow next to the A with a red bar under it. Find a color you like, select it, and the highlighted text in your document changes to that color.</p>


<h2 class="h2">Paragraph</h2>

<p class="txt">The third area of the Home Ribbon tab is the Paragraph section. At the top left of this section, you will find three important icons that enable you to use outlines, with either bullets or numbers. Highlight the text you have written in your document and click each of these items to see what happens. This is a great feature for taking notes or planning out a final paper for a course. Under those options are button icons to <em>justify</em>, or align where your text will appear in your document. The first is the Left Justify, which is what you will use most of the time. This will keep a straight left margin, and when you type and get to the end of a line, the computer will wrap the final word down to the next line, flush with the left margin. There is no need to hyphenate words in this scenario. The second icon is Center Justify. Use this to center text on your page. The third is Right Justify, where everything typed will line up along a straight right margin. The final option here is simply called Justify. This is for when you want to align text equally between the left and right margins, to make it look like a published book. This is not the same as Center Justify, where the text would be simply placed in the center of the line.</p>



<h3 class="h3">Paragraph Indenting and Spacing</h3>

<p class="txt">When you work with paragraphs of text, there will be times when you want to control the indentation, spacing, and so on. To do so, click your mouse in the paragraph you want toformat and then click on the tiny square with an angled arrow pointing down and to the right-hand corner within the Paragraph section. Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word, in turn, will display a dialog box with which you can control the paragraph settings. </p>


<a id="p236"></a>


<h3 class="h3">Sorting</h3>

<p class="txt">One final icon to note in this section is the Sort icon, which has an A and Z on it. This icon is a great feature when you are alphabetizing a list of names, such as when you are building a bibliography. If you have lots of authors listed and they are not in alphabetical order, highlight them, select this button, and Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word will organize for you. Numbers can also be sorted. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Styles </h2>


<p class="txt">The fourth area of the Home Ribbon is the Styles section. All of your text can be assigned different styles, and the default is called <em>Normal</em>. There are lots of different options. For example, if you want to have a dramatic title for your paper, go to your first page, highlight your title, and select the Title style. Or, if you are writing a paper with subheadings, you can do the same thing for added emphasis. Highlight your subsection name and then select one of the heading styles. </p>


<p class="txt">While we&rsquo;re on the subject of styles, if you do not use one of the predefined styles discussed earlier but want to &ldquo;style&rdquo; a selection of text and then &ldquo;paint&rdquo; or duplicate that style to other areas of text, you can use the Format Painter icon in the Clipboard group. Clicking that icon allows you to &ldquo;paint&rdquo; the style of one group of selected text (say bold, italics, and orange font color at 24-point size) onto another group of selected text. This saves you from selecting the other group of text and applying each of those style format items one-by-one. You are copying the style elements of one group of selected text onto another group so they look identical in format. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Find and Replace </h2>


<p class="txt">The final area of the Home Ribbon, all the way to the right of your screen, is the Editing section. The most important part of this is the Find option with the binoculars. When you have a very long document and you want to search for a specific word or phrase, select this, and Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will find it for you. An even more powerful feature is the Replace option. Let&rsquo;s say that you realized you mistyped an author&rsquo;s name many times in a document. You should not try to change all of them yourself; let Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word do it. If the author&rsquo;s name was &ldquo;John Reed&rdquo; and you accidentally called him &ldquo;John Read,&rdquo; click Replace, enter &ldquo;John Read&rdquo; in the &ldquo;Find What&rdquo; section, then type &ldquo;John Reed&rdquo; in the Replace With box. Finally, select Replace All, and Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word fixes your entire document. </p>
