</div>

<p class="txt">After you open up PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup>, you should see the help button is at the upper right. On the bottom right you will see the slide number. At the bottom right of the screen, you will also see the Zoom feature. You should experiment with different magnifications to see what you like best. Finally, the Home Ribbon is the default display of menu options. There are several of these sections that are the same as the Word Home Ribbon, such as Font, Paragraph, and Insert. We will not repeat the information describing them here because they perform the same functions. If you want a refresher, please see the sections in the Word tutorial in either Appendix A or Appendix B that describe them. </p>




<h2 class="h2">The Main Slide </h2>


<p class="txt">The main thing you will notice right away about PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> is the large, white rectangle in the center of the screen. This is your first slide! The two smaller rectangles within it are waiting for you to add a title to your presentation. The main title goes in the first box, and then a subtitle in the second box. Beneath the slide, you will see a section of the window that has the text &ldquo;Click to add notes.&rdquo; Often, when you are creating a presentation that you will deliver to a live audience, you will want to make some notes to yourself about what to say. Remember, do not include all of your thoughts on the slides themselves. These note sections are invisible to your audience. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Basic Slide Functions </h2>


<p class="txt">Start by clicking in the center of the Click to Add Title box. Begin typing, and you will see your words displayed at the center of your first slide. Now look to the left side of your screen. You will also see the words you just typed in a smaller box. This panel is very important because it shows you a preview of your slides and the order they are in. After you have entered your title, go back to the Slides section of the Home Ribbon and select New Slide. You will see that a second slide is created with a different layout than the first. You can change the layout just like before. If you decide that you want your second slide to come first, this is an easy change to make. In the left panel, click on the second slide to highlight it. Then click and drag (press and hold the left mouse button and slide up) until a horizontal bar appears on top of the first slide. Now release the mouse button, and you have just rearranged the order of your slides. To delete a slide, highlight it in the slide pane and click the scissor icon within the Quick Access Toolbar to cut the slide from your presentation. </p>


<a id="p250"></a>


<h2 class="h2">Insert Options </h2>


<p class="txt">The Insert section is under the Home Ribbon. These functions allow you to insert various items into your slides. </p>


<p class="txt">As you can see, PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> makes it easy for you to insert a movie or audio clip within your presentation. When you click on the menu options, PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> will open a window within which you can search for the file you desire. Be careful when you insert media into your presentation. Video and audio files can be very large and can make your presentation files equally large. In addition, there may be times when the computer that you are going to use to play your presentation does not have appropriate hardware or software to play the media. </p>


<p class="txt">PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> lets you insert shapes, callouts, and drawings into your documents. Now create a new slide and change your slide layout to blank. This will give you room to experiment with some shapes. Within the Home tab, select the Insert section&rsquo;s Shape pull-down list. Power-Point<Sup>&reg;</Sup> will display a menu of shape types. Using the submenus, select a shape you desire and place it on your slide. Now select your shape by clicking on it, and then use the Quick Styles icon within the Home tab&rsquo;s Format section to see how you can change the shape&rsquo;s look and color. </p>


<p class="txt">Your slide is currently using PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup>&rsquo;s default look and feel. You can change this if you like. In fact, this is a good time to look at the Themes Ribbon. </p>

</div>
     
<p class="txt">This ribbon demonstrates the many different layout themes that you can select for your opening slide, or any slide thereafter. Their names are helpful in identifying what they are. </p>


<p class="txt">If you hover your mouse over a theme icon, PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> will display the theme name. In addition to selecting a theme to control the colors and design of your slides, you can also choose your slide layout, the options of which will be theme dependent. From the Home tab Slides section, select the Layout pull-down menu. PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup>, in turn, will display different slide layouts from which you can choose. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Background Styles </h2>


<p class="txt">Once you find a general theme you like, you can modify it with the Theme Options section of the Themes toolbar. The first is called Colors, and when you select it, you will see a series of color options. The second is Fonts, and this will allow you to change the font styles throughout all of your slides. You can change individual text fonts as you create your slides, but this option will change the default throughout. If you want an even more dramatic color change, move over to the final section of this ribbon, which is called Background. By selecting Background Styles and then Format Background, you can change the slides to a solid color, a gradient fill (shading from light to dark), or even use an image for the background. </p>

<p class="txt">Finally, we can begin to put everything together. Hopefully, by this point you have several slides that you have created in our practice session. If not, go ahead and quickly create at least three. Put text on some and graphics on the others. Once you have done this, you are ready for the Slide Show Ribbon. </p>



<h2 class="h2">Starting a Slide Show </h2>


<p class="txt">This is where you will be when you are ready to begin your presentation, or it is where you will go if you want to run someone else&rsquo;s presentation that they have sent you. The first section of this ribbon is called Play Slide Show. This is the most basic way to run it (running it means that all of the PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> icons disappear, and all you will see is your slide maximized to fill the screen or monitor). The first option, which is called From Start, will start the presentation at the very first slide and sequentially display each slide until it reaches the last one. The second option, called From Current Slide, will start it at whatever slide you are currently viewing. The Broadcast Show is a very cool feature that lets you present your slide show to other remote users via their web browser! Finally, the Custom Shows option will let you create a new viewing order without rearranging the slides. For example, you can have it start the presentation on slide 2, then go to slide 1, and finally jump to slide 3. </p>



<h2 class="h2">Setting Up a Slide Show </h2>


<p class="txt">The second section of the Slide Show Ribbon is called Presenter Tools. There are several advanced features you will become more familiar with as you become more comfortable with PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup>. For now, just know that if you want to insert your own voice into your slides, this is where you would do it. First, you will need a microphone so the computer can digitize your voice, and you would then select the Record Slide Show option. </p>

<h1 class="h1"> <span class="sec_title">Part D: The View Buttons</span></h1>
</div>
 <div class="section-body">


<p class="txt">At the bottom left corner of your PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> window, you will find the View buttons that let you control common operations. The first button is called Normal View. This should be the view in which you spend the majority of your time. When you have lots of slides and you are uncertain of how you want to arrange them, switch to the Slide Sorter view, using the second button. This will give you small icons of all of your slides, and you can drag them around in any order you like. When you switch back to the Normal view, you will see your new arrangement. The third icon, called Slide Show, is simply another way to run your presentation. </p>
