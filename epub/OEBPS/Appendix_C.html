<p class="txt">The following tutorial uses PowerPoint<Sup>&reg; </Sup>2010. However, if you are using PowerPoint<Sup>&reg; </Sup>2007,you should find that your screens are nearly identical and the processing the same. You will learn how to design and edit your own slides and add transitions, effects, sounds, graphics, and many other features. It is a good idea to have PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> open while you are reading through the following sections. This will help you make sense of the new concepts. Practice as you read along. </p>

<p class="txt">The PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Home Ribbon tab between the two versions of 2007 and 2010 are almost identical, with the exception of the Microsoft Office<Sup>&reg;</Sup> button (which is seen in the upper left corner across all the Microsoft Office<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2007 applications) and the File tab (which is seen in the upper left corner across the Microsoft Office<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2010 applications). You can instantly display PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> help by pressing the F1 function key or clicking on the blue circle question mark in the far right corner of the ribbon. On the bottom left you will see the slide number. At the bottom right of the screen you will also see the Zoom feature. You should experiment with different magnifications to see what you like best. Finally, the Home Ribbon tab is the default display of menu options. Several of these sections are the same as the Word Home Ribbon tab, such as Clipboard, Font, Paragraph, and Editing. We will not repeat the information describing them here because they perform the same functions. If you want a refresher, please see the sections in the Word tutorial in either Appendix A or Appendix B that describe them. </p>
     


<h2 class="h2">Templates and Themes </h2>


<p class="txt">Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>provides a nice array of preconfigured PowerPoint<Sup>&reg; </Sup>presentations, templates, and themes for you to use as guides and models for your own projects. You can access them by clicking the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Office button in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2007 and selecting New from the menu or by clicking the File tab and selecting New from that menu in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2010. Alternatively, you could click the Create button in each window to begin your own new presentation from scratch. Feel free to load up an existing presentation or theme and experiment. </p>




<h2 class="h2">The Main Slide </h2>


<p class="txt">The main thing you will notice right away about PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> is the large, white rectangle in the center of the screen. This is your first slide, and it&rsquo;s a special one! The two smaller rectangles within it are waiting for you to add a title to your presentation. The main title goes in the first box, and then a subtitle in the second box. These boxes are known as <em>placeholders</em>. This is the default layout of your title slide. You can change this if you like. In fact, this is a good time to look at the Slides section of the ribbon. First, select the drop-down box next to the Layout icon. </p>

<a id="p244"></a>

<p class="txt">This demonstrates the many different layout options, which you can select for your opening slide or any slide thereafter. Their names are helpful in identifying what they are. For example, if you want a slide that includes a picture and a caption, select the Picture with Caption layout. Sometimes, you will want to start with a completely blank slide. In this case, you should select the Blank option. For now, though, leave the Title Slide layout as the default. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Saving and Printing Your Presentation </h2>


<p class="txt">Using the File menu, you can save your presentation, print your presentation, or open an existing presentation. As you create presentations, you should save your work on a regular basis, such as after completing a new slide. Pay very close attention when you go to print, via either the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Office button in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2007 or the File tab in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2010. There are many options and variations to consider. For example, you can choose to print one slide per page, only certain slides, current slide, multiple slides per page, notes pages, handouts, in color, in grayscale, and so on. The options are varied, and it is worth experimenting to get used to them. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Basic Slide Functions </h2>


<p class="txt">Start by clicking in the center of the Click to Add Title box. Begin typing, and you will see your words displayed at the center of your first slide. Now look to the left side of your screen. You will also see the words you just typed in a smaller box. This window pane (called the <em>slide pane</em>) is important because it shows you a preview of your slides and the order they are in. After you have entered your title, go back to the Slides section of the ribbon and click the New Slide button. You will see that a second slide is created with a different layout than the first. </p>


<p class="txt">This is a default Title &amp; Content slide. You can click and type to add a title at the top. Then, in the lower part of the slide, you can click and add text in bullet form. A general rule of thumb is no more than seven bullets per slide and no more than seven words per bullet. Notice there are six icons in the center of the blank slide. Each of these icons represents the kind of content that can be added to a slide (table, chart, SmartArt graphic, picture, clip art, or media). </p>


<p class="txt">You can also pick a different kind of slide layout by clicking the down arrow on the New Slide button. You will see that it is nearly identical to the Layout drop-down mentioned earlier. An important addition&mdash;<em>Duplicate Selected Slides</em>&mdash;allows you to duplicate a slide you just made, and then you can edit it as you see fit. This is a great time-saver. </p>


<p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s say that as you are building your slide presentation, you want one slide to switch order with another one. In this case, you decide you want your second slide to come first. The change is simple to make. In the left slide pane, click on the second slide to highlight it. Next click and drag (press and hold the left mouse button and slide up) until a horizontal bar appears on top of the first slide. Now release the mouse button, and you have just rearranged the order of your slides. To delete a slide, highlight it in the slide pane and click the Delete icon. </p>

<a id="p245"></a>

<p class="txt">As you were working, you might have noticed the Outline tab in the left slide pane. If you click on this tab, it will show each of your slides, their title, and bullet text contained on the individual slides, in an outline format. You can click on any of them and be taken directly to that slide. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Slide Drawings </h2>


<p class="txt">Another section on this ribbon to explore is Drawing. Create a new slide and change your slide layout to blank. This will give you room to experiment with some of these features. At the left side of the Drawing section, you will see some shapes. Scroll through and pay attention to the variety available. Place the desired shape on your slide by selecting that shape and hovering your mouse over the slide in the approximate location where you want the shape to go. You will see a crosshair appear (+); click the left mouse button and drag until the size of the drawing shape is about what you want. You can then release the mouse button. Remember, this is an object on the slide, which means it can now be moved, resized, colored, and so on. You can also place a text box on a slide and type text in it. Experiment and add some more shapes to your slide. Now select either one of your shapes or your text box and try out the Quick Styles icon to see how you can change the look and color. Remember, you have to click on a shape in order to activate the object first. </p>

<div class="section-header">
<h1 class="h1"> <span class="sec_title">Part B: The Insert Ribbon Tab</span></h1>
</div>
 <div class="section-body">


<p class="txt">You will use the Insert Ribbon tab when you want to insert various items into your slides. In this section, we will focus on the features you will find here. </p>



<h2 class="h2">Links </h2>


<p class="txt">To include a hyperlink on your slide, highlight some sample text on your slide and then select the Hyperlink icon. You will then see an Address bar at the bottom where you can enter in the name of any website. Click OK when you are done, and you will see that the sample text you selected is an active web link (blue underlined text). If you hold down the Control button and single-click it, PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> will take you to that web page. This is helpful if you will have people viewing your project electronically, but if you were simply going to print it out and give it to someone, you would not need to use this function. </p>


<p class="txt">You will also see an icon here called Action. To see how this works, insert some text on your slide in a text box or in your title rectangle. Once you do this and click on the box, you will see that the Action button lights up. Click it, and you will find the options it gives you. This lets you tell the computer to take a specific action if you, or a viewer of your presentation, moves the mouse pointer over or clicks the text you selected. You can do this through the two tabs. The Mouse Click tab is the default, and this means you have to click on the text for your action to occur. The second tab is Mouse Over, and all that is required to trigger this event is for you to move your mouse pointer over the text. What are some of the things you can tell the computer to do? You can have it hyperlink to the web or to another slide, you can play a sound, or you can even launch another program (like Word). The default in both of these tabs is that no action will occur, so if you want something to happen, you have to define it through this option. </p>


<a id="p246"></a>


<h2 class="h2">Insert Movies and Sounds </h2>


<p class="txt">The final section, called Media Clips in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2007 and Media in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2010,consists of two icons&mdash;Movie and Sound&mdash;and it is where you will go if you want to insert a movie file or a sound file on your slide. When you click on one of these icons, it will open the appropriate subfolders of My Documents that could contain these files. Keep in mind that your media files might not be in that location, so you may need to redirect to the appropriate location. </p>

</div>

     
<p class="txt">The next PowerPoint<Sup>&reg; </Sup>ribbon is called the Design Ribbon tab. Here you&rsquo;ll learn how to change the width, height, and orientation of your slides, as well as choose a theme or background for your presentation. </p>


<h2 class="h2">Page Setup Section </h2>


<p class="txt">The first section is called Page Setup. This gives you options to change the width and height of your slides and the orientation, which consists of landscape or portrait. The default is landscape. These elements of Page Setup are identical in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2007 and 2010. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Slide Themes Section </h2>


<p class="txt">The second section of the Design Ribbon tab is called Themes. This takes up most of the real estate of the ribbon itself with a variety of small slide previews. <em>Themes</em> are suggested designs to transform the white slide we have been working with into something more visually engaging. The selection is completely up to you and whatever you think will work best for your presentation. So go ahead and experiment by selecting some themes to see what they look like. You can use the live preview feature to view the potential impact of a selected theme on your overall presentation without making a commitment! Once you decide on one that suits your presentation the best, click the theme design, and it is placed on your main slide <em>and</em> cascaded down through every slide in your presentation, including any you add after the fact. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Background Styles </h2>


<p class="txt">Once you find a general theme you like, you can modify it with the other theme-based icons to the right of this section. The first is called Colors, and when you select it, you will see a series of color options. The second is Fonts, and this will allow you to change the font styles throughout all of your slides. You can change individual text fonts as you create your slides, but this option will change the default throughout. The third is Effects and is best explored by experimentation. If you want an even more dramatic color change, move over to the final section of this ribbon, which is called Background. By selecting Background Styles and then Format Background, you can change the slides to a solid color or a gradient fill (shading from light to dark) or even use an image for the background. It is important to note that if you want to simply make this change to the current slide, select Close when you are done. If you want all the slides in your presentation to change, then finish by selecting Apply to All. </p>

<p class="txt">Finally, we can begin to put everything together. Hopefully, by this point you have several slides that you have created in our practice session. If not, go ahead and quickly create at least three. Put text on some and graphics on the others. Once you have done this, you are ready for the Slide Show Ribbon tab. </p>


<h2 class="h2">Starting a Slide Show </h2>


<p class="txt">There is one major difference between PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2007 and 2010 in this ribbon tab. It is in the area of Broadcast. The Broadcast functionality is only available in PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2010. </p>


<p class="txt">The Slide Show section is where you will be when you are ready to begin your presentation, or it is where you will go if you want to run someone else&rsquo;s presentation that they have sent you. The first section of this ribbon is called Start Slide Show. This is the most basic way to run it (running it means that all of the PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> icons disappear, and all you will see is your slide maximized to fill the screen or monitor). The first option, which is called From Beginning, will start the presentation at the very first slide and sequentially display each slide until it reaches the last one. The second option, called From Current Slide, will start it at whatever slide you are currently viewing. The Broadcast Slide Show feature lets you present your slide show to other remote users via their web browser&mdash;again, only with PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> 2010. Finally, the Custom Slide Show option will let you create a new viewing order without rearranging the slides. For example, you can have it start the presentation on slide 2, then go to slide 1, and finally jump to slide 3. </p>


<p class="txt">If you are running the slide show yourself, you can launch your presentation by hitting the F5 key on your keyboard. You can advance to the next slide in multiple ways: mouse click, space bar, up arrow on your keyboard, or Enter key. Once you have finished, you can hit the ESC or Escape key to drop out of the Slide Show view into the Normal view. </p>


<p class="txt">It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that in the lower right-hand corner of your PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> screen taskbar, there are some buttons that affect viewing. The first icon is Normal view. The second icon is Slide Sorter view, which allows you to reorder your slide presentation by viewing of the slides and to click and drag them into whatever order you like. </p>


<p class="txt">The third icon represents Slide Show view, which launches your presentation. The icon on the far right is fit slide to current window, which shows your slide as large as your window. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Setting Up a Slide Show </h2>


<p class="txt">Another section of the Slide Show Ribbon tab is called Set Up. There are several advanced features you will become more familiar with as you become more comfortable with PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup>. For now, just know that if you want to insert your own voice into your slides, this is where you would do it. First, you will need a microphone so the computer can digitize your voice, and you would then select the Record Narration option. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Monitors </h2>


<p class="txt">The final section of the Slide Show Ribbon tab is called Monitors. There are also more advanced options, but if you wanted to change the resolution of the presentation (making it higher or lower than you would typically view), this is where you would do it. If you have two or more monitors hooked up to your computer, you can also define which of them the presentation will appear on with the Show Presentation On button. Usually, you would want the presentation to appear on the largest monitor with the best resolution. </p>

<div class="section-header">
<h1 class="h1"> <span class="sec_title">Part E: The View Ribbon Tab</span></h1>
</div>
 <div class="section-body">


<p class="txt">The final PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> ribbon tab is the View Ribbon tab. This ribbon tab is basically identical in both versions of PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup>&mdash;with the exception of a few word changes on the menu&mdash;and mimics the lower right PowerPoint<Sup>&reg;</Sup> task bar icons discussed previously. The first section is called Presentation Views. This is a way to organize your screen for editing your presentation or printing it out to share with your audience. The first icon is the Normal view. This should be the view in which you spend the majority of your time. When you have lots of slides and you are uncertain of how you want to arrange them, switch to the Slide Sorter view. This will give you small icons of all of your slides, and you can drag them around in any order you like. When you switch back to the Normal view, you will see your new arrangement. The third option is the Notes Page. Often, when you are creating a presentation that you will deliver to a live audience, you will want to make some notes to yourself about what to say. Remember, do not include all of your thoughts on the slides themselves. These note sections are invisible to your audience. The notes that you leave to yourself are entered in a horizontal window pane at the bottom of each individual slide. Just click in the pane and type. The fourth icon, called Slide Show, is simply another way to run your presentation. </p>


<p class="txt">An advanced set of options you can ignore for now appears with the Slide Master button. When you select this, a new ribbon will appear that will let you change many of the defaults that appear when you create a new slide. To exit out of it, select the big red X on the right called Close Master View. The final areas of the View Ribbon should be familiar to you from Word, such as Zoom, Window, and Macro options. </p>
