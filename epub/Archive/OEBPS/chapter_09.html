<p class="txt">Note-taking and reading are two compatible skill sets. Beyond providing a record of the information you are reading or hearing, notes help you organize the ideas being presented and help you make meaning out of something with which you may not be familiar. Strong notes build on your prior knowledge of a subject, help you discuss trends or patterns present in the information, and direct you toward areas needing further research or reading. </p>


<p class="txt">Note-taking may not be the most glamorous aspect of your higher education journey, but it is a study practice you will carry throughout college and into your professional life. Setting yourself up for successful note-taking is almost as important as the actual taking of notes, and what you do after your note-taking session is equally significant. Well-written notes help you organize your thoughts, enhance your memory, and participate in class discussion, and they prepare you to respond successfully on exams. With all that riding on your notes, it would behoove you to learn how to take notes properly and continue to improve your note-taking skills. </p>

			<p class="txt">Preparing to take notes means more than just getting out your laptop or making sure you bring pen and paper to class or a study session. You&rsquo;ll do a much better job with your notes if you understand why we take notes, have a strong grasp of your preferred note-taking system, determine your specific priorities depending on your situation, and engage in some version of efficient shorthand. </p>


			<p class="txt">Like handwriting and fingerprints, we all have unique and fiercely independent note-taking habits. These understandably vary from one situation to the next, but you can only improve your skills by learning more about ways to take effective notes and trying different methods to find a good fit. </p>


			<p class="txt">The very best notes are the ones you take in an organized manner that encourages frequent review and use as you progress through a topic or course of study. For this reason, you need to develop a way to organize all your notes for each class so they remain together and organized. As old-fashioned as it sounds, a clunky three-ring binder is an excellent organizational container for class notes. You can easily add to previous notes, insert handouts you may receive in class, and maintain a running collection of materials for each separate course. If this method doesn&rsquo;t appeal to you, however, then transfer that same structure into your computer files. If you don&rsquo;t organize your many documents into some semblance of order on your computer, you will waste significant time searching for improperly named or saved files. </p>

<a id="p141"></a>

			<p class="txt">Whichever of the many note-taking systems you choose (and new ones seem to come out almost daily), the very best one is the one that you will use consistently. The skill and art of note-taking is not automatic for anyone; it takes a great deal of practice, patience, and continuous attention to detail. Add to that the fact that you may need to master multiple note-taking techniques for different classes, and you have some work to do. Unless you are specifically directed by your instructor, you are free to combine the best parts of different systems if you are most comfortable with that hybrid system. </p>

			<p class="txt">You may have a standard way you take all your notes for all your classes. When you were in high school, this one-size-fits-all approach may have worked. Now that you&rsquo;re in college, reading and studying more advanced topics, your general method may still work some of the time, but you should have some different strategies in place if you find that your method isn&rsquo;t working as well with college content. You probably will need to adopt different note-taking strategies for different subjects. The strategies in this section represent various ways to take notes in such a way that you are able to study most effectively after the initial note-taking session. </p>


			<h2 class="h2">Cornell Method </h2>


			<p class="txt">One of the most recognizable note-taking systems is called the <strong>Cornell method</strong>, a relatively simple way to take effective notes devised by Cornell University education professor Dr. Walter Pauk in the 1940s. In this system, you take a standard piece of notebook paper and divide it into three sections by drawing a horizontal line across your paper about 1 to 2 inches from the bottom of the page (the summary area) and then drawing a vertical line to separate the rest of the page above this bottom area, making the left side about 2 inches (the questions column) and leaving the biggest area to the right of your vertical line (the notes column; see Figure 9.1). You may want to make one page and then copy as many pages as you think you&rsquo;ll need for any particular class, but one advantage of this system is that you can generate the sections quickly. </p>


			<p class="txt">Because you have divided up your page, you may end up using more paper than you would if you were writing on the entire page, but the point is not to keep your notes to as few pages as possible. The Cornell method provides you with a well&ndash;organized set of notes that will help you study and review your notes as you move through the course. If you are taking notes on your computer, you can still use the Cornell method in Word or Excel on your own or by using a template someone else created. </p>

			<p class="txt">Now that you have the note-taking format generated, the beauty of the Cornell method is its organized simplicity. Just write on one side of the page (the right-hand notes column)&mdash;this will help later when you are reviewing and revising your notes. During your note-taking session, use the notes column to record information on the main points and concepts of the lecture or reading; try to put the ideas into your own words, which will help you avoid transcribing the speaker&rsquo;s or writer&rsquo;s words verbatim. Skip lines between each idea in this column. </p>

<a id="p143"></a>

			<p class="txt">Practice the shortcut abbreviations covered in the next section and avoid writing in complete sentences. Don&rsquo;t make your notes too cryptic, but you can use bullet points or phrases equally well to convey meaning&mdash;we do it all the time in conversation. If you know you will need to expand the notes you are taking in class but don&rsquo;t have time, you can put reminders directly in the notes by adding and underlining the word &ldquo;expand&rdquo; by the ideas you need to develop more fully. </p>


			<p class="txt">As soon as possible after your note-taking session, preferably within 8 hours but no more than 24 hours, read over your notes column and fill in any details you missed, including the places where you indicated you wanted to expand your notes. Then in the questions column, use one-to two-word descriptions to explain or define any key ideas from the corresponding notes column. The words in the questions column serve as cues to help you remember the detailed information you recorded in the notes column. </p>


			<p class="txt">Once you are satisfied with your notes and questions columns, summarize this page of notes in two or three sentences using the summary area at the bottom of the sheet. This is an excellent time to get with another classmate or a group of students who all heard the same lecture or did the same reading to make sure you all understood the key points. Now, before you move on to something else, cover the large notes column and quiz yourself over the key ideas you recorded in the questions column. Repeat this step often as you go along, not just immediately before an exam, and you will help your memory make the connections between your notes, your textbook reading, your in-class work, and your assignments. </p>


			<p class="txt">The main advantage of the Cornell method is that you are setting yourself up to have organized, workable notes. The neat, standardized format helps you move into study mode without needing to make sense of a large mass of information you aren&rsquo;t sure how to process because you can&rsquo;t remember key ideas or what you meant. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Outlining </h2>


			<p class="txt">Other note organizing systems, such as <strong>outlining</strong>, may help you in different disciplines. You can take notes in a formal outline if you prefer, using Roman numerals for each new topic, moving down a line to capital letters indented a few spaces to the right for concepts related to the previous topic, then adding details to support the concepts indented a few more spaces over and denoted by an Arabic numeral. You can continue to add to a formal outline by following these rules. </p>


			<p class="txt">The following formal outline example shows the basic pattern. </p>

             <span class="no_spacein_ul_ol">
			 <ol class="nl">
                   <li class="li_text" type="I" start="I">Goals <em>(main topic&mdash;usually general)</em>


			 <ol class="nl">
                    <li class="li_text" type="A" start="1">Personal goals <em>(concept related to main topic)</em>
					 <ol class="nl" type="1">
							<li class="li_text">Spend more time with family <em>(supporting information about the concept) </em></li>

							<li class="li_text">Learn to rock climb </li>

							<li class="li_text">Eat healthier foods</li>
					</ol>
					</li>

                    <li class="li_text"  type="A" start="2">Academic goals<em>(concept related to main topic)</em>
						<ol class="nl" type="1">
								<li class="li_text">Earn a degree <em>(supporting information about the concept)</em></li>

								<li class="li_text">Get good grades</li>

								<li class="li_text">Learn more about my chosen field</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
				</ol></li>

					

                  <li class="li_text"  type="I" start="II">Values <em>(main topic)</em>

					 <ol class="nl">
							<li class="li_text"  type="A" start="1">Personal relationships</li>
					 </ol>
					 
				  </li>

			 </ol>
			 </span>
<a id="p144"></a>
			 
			<p class="txt">You would just continue with this sort of numbering and indenting format to show the connections between main ideas, concepts, and supporting details. Whatever details you do not capture in your note-taking session, you can add after the lecture or reading as you review your outline. </p>


			<p class="txt">You don&rsquo;t have to use the formal numerals and letters, but whatever symbols you choose for your outline should be consistent across topics. You should also indent consistently so you can tell when you move from a higher level topic, to the related concepts, to the supporting information. The main benefit of an outline is how organized it is. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Chart or Table </h2>


			<p class="txt">Similar to creating an outline, you can develop a chart to compare and contrast main ideas in a note-taking session. Divide your paper into four or five columns with headings that include either the main topics covered or categories such as How?, What?, When used?, Advantages/Pros, Disadvantages/Cons, or other divisions of the information (see Table 9.1). You write your notes into the appropriate columns as that information comes to light in the presentation. </p>

			<p class="txt">This format helps you pull out the salient ideas and establishes an organized set of notes to study later. </p>


			<p class="txt">You may have noticed by now that the idea of reviewing your notes later is a constant across all note-taking systems. Notes by themselves that you never reference again are little more than scribblings. That would be a bit like compiling an extensive grocery list so you stay on budget when you shop, work all week on it, and then just throw it away before you get to the store. You may be able to recall a few items, but you likely won&rsquo;t be as efficient as you could be if you had the notes to reference. Just as you cannot read all the many books, articles, and documents you need to peruse for your college classes over and over, you cannot remember the most important ideas of all the notes you will take as part of your courses, so you must review. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Concept Mapping and Visual Note-Taking </h2>


			<p class="txt">One final note-taking method that appeals to learners who prefer a visual representation of notes is called <em>mapping</em>, or sometimes <em>mind mapping</em> or <em>concept mapping</em>, although each of these names can have slightly different uses. Variations of this method abound, so you may want to look for more versions online; some can get rather elaborate with colors and shapes, but a simple version may be more useful, at least to begin. The basic principle of <strong>mapping</strong> is that you are making connections between main ideas through a graphic depiction (see Figure 9.2). A student using a basic version of concept mapping draws a circle or a square around main ideas, and then uses connecting lines to branch out from the main idea to supporting concepts. A combination of shapes and connecting lines would also be used between the supporting concepts and supporting details. You can present your main ideas vertically or horizontally, but turning your paper longways, or in landscape mode, may prove helpful as you add more main ideas. </p>


<a id="p145"></a>

At the top of the figure is a large circle labeled &ldquo;Main idea&rdquo; with two lines extending out to two smaller circles labeled &ldquo;Supporting concept 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supporting concept 2.&rdquo; Two additional lines branch out from each of the supporting concept circles and connect to smaller circles labeled &ldquo;Supporting detail.&rdquo;" title="Sample mind map. At the top of the figure is a large circle labeled &ldquo;Main idea&rdquo; with two lines extending out to two smaller circles labeled &ldquo;Supporting concept 1&rdquo; and &ldquo;Supporting concept 2.&rdquo; Two additional lines branch out from each of the supporting concept circles and connect to smaller circles labeled &ldquo;Supporting detail.&rdquo;" id="fig9.2"/>
					  
			   </figure>


			<p class="txt">You may be interested in trying <strong>visual note-taking </strong>or adding pictures to your notes for clarity (see Figure 9.3). Sometimes when you can&rsquo;t come up with the exact wording to explain something or you&rsquo;re trying to add information for complex ideas in your notes, sketching a rough image of the idea can help you remember. According to educator Sherrill Knezel (2016), this strategy is effective because &ldquo;when students use images and text in note-taking, it gives them two different ways to pull up the information, doubling their chances of recall&rdquo; (para. 5). Don&rsquo;t shy away from this creative approach to note-taking just because you believe you aren&rsquo;t an artist; the images don&rsquo;t need to be perfect. </p>

			<p class="txt">Take the time to play with different types of note-taking suggestions and find the method(s) you like best, but once you find what works for you, stick with it. You will become more efficient with the method the more you use it, and your note-taking, review, and test prep will become, if not easier, certainly more organized, which can decrease your anxiety. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Practicing Decipherable Shorthand </h2>


			<p class="txt">Once the domain of secretaries and executive assistants, <strong>shorthand</strong>, a method of writing quickly using abbreviations and symbols in place of full words or phrases, is an almost lost art in the age of computers. Although most college students don&rsquo;t take a class in shorthand, this technique could come in very handy during intense note-taking sessions. Elaborate shorthand systems do exist, but you would be better served in your college note-taking adventures to hone a more familiar, personalized form of shorthand to help you write more in a shorter amount of time. Seemingly insignificant shortcuts can add up to ease the stress note-taking can induce&mdash;especially if you ever encounter an &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to repeat this&rdquo; kind of presenter! Table 9.2 includes a number of useful shorthand abbreviations, but feel free to make use of whatever method might work best for you. For example, some students may feel more comfortable using &ldquo;texting language&rdquo; (see Table 9.3) when taking notes. </p>

			<p class="txt">Annotating notes after the initial note-taking session may be one of the most valuable study skills you can master. Whether you are highlighting, underlining, or adding additional notes, you are reinforcing the material in your mind and memory. </p>


			<p class="txt">The only reason to highlight anything is to draw attention to it, so you can easily pick out the important information later for further study or reflection. One problem many students have is not knowing when to stop highlighting. And if you don&rsquo;t rein in this tendency to color long passages (possibly in multiple colors) you can end up with a whole page of highlighted text. Ironically, that is no different from a page that is not highlighted at all, so you have wasted your time. Your mantra for highlighting text should be &ldquo;less is more.&rdquo; If what you need to recall from the passage is a particularly apt and succinct definition of the term important to your discipline, highlighting the entire paragraph is less effective than highlighting just the actual term. Always read your text selection first before you start highlighting anything. You need to know what the overall message is before you start placing emphasis in the text with highlighting. </p>


			<p class="txt">Another way to annotate notes after initial note-taking is underlining significant words or passages. Albeit not quite as much fun as its colorful cousin highlighting, underlining provides precision to your emphasis. </p>


			<p class="txt">While highlighting and underlining are perhaps the most commonly known forms of annotation, annotating can refer to anything you do with a text to enhance it for your particular use. Your annotations may include highlighting passages or vocabulary you don&rsquo;t know, defining those unfamiliar terms once you look them up, writing questions in the margin of a book, underlining or circling key terms, or otherwise marking a text for future reference (see Figure 9.4). </p>

			<p class="txt">Realistically, you may end up doing all of these types of annotations at different times. We know that repetition in studying and reviewing is critical to learning, so you may come back to the same passage and annotate it separately. These various markings can be invaluable to you as a study guide and as a way to see the evolution of your learning about a topic. If you regularly begin a reading session by writing down any questions you may have about the topic of that chapter or section and then write out answers to those questions at the end of the reading selection, you will have a good reference for what that chapter covered when you eventually need to study for an exam or work on an assignment. </p>

	<a id="p150"></a>
 
			<p class="txt">Don&rsquo;t forget you can also annotate some electronic texts. Almost all electronic reading platforms allow readers to highlight and underline text. Some devices also allow you to add a written text that you can collect at the end of your note-taking session. Look into the specific tools for your device and learn how to use the features that allow you to take notes electronically. You can also find apps on devices to help with taking notes, some of which you may have automatically installed when you bought the product. Microsoft&rsquo;s OneNote, Google Keep, and the Notes feature on phones are relatively easy to use, and you may already have free access to those. </p>

        <h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Tech Tips: </strong> Note-Taking Apps</h4>
        <div class="aside_content">
        
			<p class="txt">Whether taking notes from an in-person lecture, in an online classroom, or even from reading, the key to good note-taking is understanding concepts, noting main points, and clarifying those main points with supporting details. </p>


			<p class="txt">Unique to an online classroom is the ability to reaccess or record information that might have been missed the first time it was introduced. In a live, in-person lecture, your instructor may only provide details once, so you have to be certain to write information down as it is stated. In an online environment, you can often access the same lessons more than once to ensure that you have grasped the main ideas. Therefore, you can spend more time identifying main ideas and ensuring your understanding while taking your notes, rather than making sure that you&rsquo;re copying all the words as they&rsquo;re stated. Apps that can assist you with your online note-taking include the following. </p>



		  <ul class="bl">

		   <li class="li_text">Evernote (<a class="link"  href="https://evernote.com" target="_blank">https://evernote.com</a>) is compatible with all popular devices and operating systems. It has a scanning function that allows for both handwritten and typed notes to be captured and saved in the same space. Evernote can also record and save audio notes if you prefer to dictate your notes verbally, for example, while reading. As an organizational tool, Evernote also allows you to bookmark webpages and clip quotes or other web content, which you can then file among your notes by related subject, course title, or another organizational method of your choosing. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Simplenote (<a class="link"  href="https://simplenote.com" target="_blank">https://simplenote.com</a>) is another web-based note-taking app that is less complex and sophisticated than Evernote but can lessen your need to learn new software while also learning new course content. Simplenote allows you to save and organize typed, text-based notes only, but you can easily organize your notes within the program. Simplenote also lets you pin important notes to the top of text lists, so that main ideas within your notes are more easily identifiable&mdash;which helps when you go back to study your notes. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Microsoft OneNote (<a class="link"  href="https://www.onenote.com" target="_blank">https://www.onenote.com</a>) and Google Keep (<a class="link"  href="https://keep.google.com" target="_blank">https://keep.google.com</a>) provide text-based note-taking and organizational functions similar to those offered by Simplenote but may already be embedded and integrated with other tools from those companies that you already use. </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">Keep in mind that your notes, regardless of where you capture and save them, are only as useful as how you <em>use</em> them&mdash;review your notes, make connections between ideas, and study from them as you prepare for exams. </p>


        </div>
      </aside>


			<br/>
		


			<p class="txt">What you have to keep in the front of your mind while you are annotating, especially if you are going to conduct multiple annotation sessions, is not to overdo whatever method you use. Be judicious about what you annotate and how you do it on the page (in other words, be neat about it). Otherwise, you&rsquo;ll end up with a mess of either colors or symbols combined with some cryptic notes that probably took you quite a long time to create but won&rsquo;t be worth as much to you as a study aid as they could be. This is simply a waste of time and effort. </p>


	<a id="p151"></a>
 
			<p class="txt">You cannot eat up every smidgen of white space on the page writing out questions or summaries and still have a way to read the original text. If you are lucky enough to have a blank page next to the beginning of the chapter or section you are annotating, use this, but keep in mindthat when you start writing notes, you aren&rsquo;t exactly sure how much space you&rsquo;ll need. Use a decipherable shorthand and write only what you need to convey the meaning in very small print. If you are annotating your own notes, you can make a habit of using only one side of the paper when you first take notes, so that if you need to add more notes later, you can use the other side. You can also add a blank page to your notes before beginning the next class date in your notebook so you&rsquo;ll end up with extra paper for annotations when you study. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Taking Notes on Nontext Items </h2>


			<p class="txt">As part of your readings, you may encounter important nontext items such as graphics, charts, graphs, and other visual items. It is important to take notes on these items because not onlydo they often convey important information, they may also appear on exams or in other situations in which you&rsquo;ll need to use or demonstrate knowledge. The approach to taking notes on nontext items is similar to taking notes on a passage of text. For example, if you encountered the map in Figure 9.5, you might start by asking yourself the following questions. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">What is the main point of this map?</li>

			<li class="li_text">Who is the intended audience? </li>

			<li class="li_text">Where is it? </li>

			<li class="li_text">What time period does it depict?</li>

			<li class="li_text">What does the map&rsquo;s legend (the explanation of symbols) include?</li>

			<li class="li_text">What other information do I need to make sense of this map? </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">You may want to make an extra copy of a graphic or table before you add annotations if you are dealing with a lot of information. Making sense of all the elements will take time, and you don&rsquo;t want your notes to add to the confusion. Remember to also read any captions, sources, or notes that may accompany nontext items; these provide context and additional information you can use to understand what you are seeing. </p>




			<h2 class="h2">Returning to Your Notes </h2>


			<p class="txt">Think of all notes as potential study guides. In fact, if you only take notes without actively working on them after the initial note-taking session, the likelihood of the notes helping you is slim. Research on this topic concludes that without active engagement after taking notes, most students forget about 60% of the material about which they took notes&mdash;within 2 days! That sort of defeats the purpose, don&rsquo;t you think? This information about memory loss was first brought to light by 19th-century German psychologist Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913). Fortunately, you do have the power to thwart what is sometimes called the Ebbinghaus forgetting curve by reinforcing what you learned through review at intervals shortly after you take in the material and frequently thereafter. </p>


			<p class="txt">If you are a musician, you&rsquo;ll understand this phenomenon well. When you first attempt a difficult piece of music, you may not remember the chords and notes well at all, but after frequent practice and review, you generate a certain muscle memory and cognitive recall that allows you to play the music more easily. </p>


			<p class="txt">The exact timing of when you get back to your notes will vary depending on what other obligations you have in your daily schedule. A good, easy-to-remember starting place is to make every effort to review your notes within 24 hours of first taking them; any longer than that and you are likely to have forgotten some key features you need to include. Use your phone or computer to set reminders, and block off specific amounts of time to review your notes so that it becomes a habit and you keep on top of the schedule. </p>

	  <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>

			<p class="txt">Your personal notes play a significant role in your success as a student. They should enhance how you understand lessons, readings, lab sessions, and assignments. All the time and effort you put into first taking the notes and then annotating and organizing the notes will be for naught if you do not formulate an effective and efficient way to use them before working on assignments or taking tests. </p>


			<p class="txt">The whole cycle of reading, note-taking, reviewing and enhancing your notes, and preparing for exams and assignments is part of a continuum you ideally will carry into your professional life. Don&rsquo;t try to take shortcuts; recognize each step in the cycle as a building block. Learning doesn&rsquo;t end, which shouldn&rsquo;t fill you with dread; it should help you recognize that all this work you&rsquo;re doing in the classroom and during your own study and review sessions is ongoing and cumulative. Practicing effective strategies now will help you be a stronger professional. </p>
