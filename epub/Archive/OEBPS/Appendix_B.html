<p class="txt">After you start Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word, a menu bar will appear at the top of your screen, which provides you with access to the common Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word operations. Using the File menu, for example, you can create a new document, print a document, and save the document&rsquo;s contents. From within the Edit menu, you can cut and paste content to and from the Clipboard (Mac<Sup>&reg;</Sup> users call it the Scrapbook). The View menu lets you change between different displays, such as the outline layout, print layout, and so on. Using the Insert menu, you can place a wide range of objects into your document, which include clip art, photos, movies, symbols, and shapes. The Format menu provides you with the ability to format fonts, paragraphs, tabs, shading, borders, and so on. Using the Font menu, you can quickly select a font that will apply to selected text or subsequent typing. The Tools menu provides you with access to features such as the spell-checker, edit tracking, and even mail-merge operations. The Table menu lets you insert and manipulate tables within your document, and finally, the Window menu lets you quickly move between documents and control document windows. </p>

</div>


<h2 class="h2">Open and Save </h2>


<p class="txt">As discussed, the File menu at the top of your screen lets you quickly perform common file operations. Within the menu, the Open option is what you should select if you want to edit an existing document you created earlier. This will open a window where you will see all of your personal files and folders. From there, find the document you want to edit, click it, and it will open in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word. The File menu Save option is important because it enables you to keep all your hard work safe and lets you access it again in the future with the Open command. Although Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word has an Autosave function, it is also a good idea to manually save your work frequently by clicking the Save button. </p>


<a id="p238"></a>


<h2 class="h2">Print </h2>


<p class="txt">The Print option is also on the File menu, and this is what you will select to send your document to a printer. When you select the Print option, another window opens with several options for you. The first is a drop-down box where you see the default printer and also a list of all other printers you can select on your computer. Then you can define which of the pages you want to print in Pages. This includes All for the entire document, Current Page for just the page where your cursor is now, and Pages, which is the option for printing a range of pages. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word Preferences </h2>


<p class="txt">There is one other important dialog box you should know about. Within the Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word menu, you will find a Preferences option. After you select it, you will find numerous options to explore here. Let&rsquo;s take a look at a few of the most helpful of these to get you started. Spelling and Grammar is the place you will go when you want to change how Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word formats and corrects the text you type. It is important to make sure the &ldquo;Check spelling as you type&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Check grammar as you type&rdquo; are checked. When they are selected, Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will underline words and phrases it thinks are grammatically incorrect or misspelled so that you can change these immediately. </p>


<p class="txt">The Save option lets you customize how Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word documents are saved. You should be saving your files in the most recent format. A <em>file format </em>is the way that a particular computer application stores its information. If you are in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word and save your file with the name FinalPaper, the program will add to this name an <em>extension</em>, which indicates the file format. The extension in Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word is .docx, and it indicates what program the computer should use to open it. Older versions of Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word save files with the .doc extension as the default. You will encounter hundreds of different file extensions as you use different programs. </p>


<p class="txt">As you submit papers for your homework assignments, there may be times when you want or are required to submit a .pdf file. PDFs are normally smaller and easier to manage than Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word documents and cannot be edited/changed by another user. To create a PDF file, select the PDF format from within the Save As dialog box. </p>




<h2 class="h2">New Document and Templates </h2>


<p class="txt">When you select the File menu New Form Template, Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will display the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word Document Gallery dialog box that contains predesigned Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word documents ready for you to use. Some of the most popular of these are brochures, calendars, faxes, newsletters, and memos. Normally, you will select the Blank template to create a new document. You can also choose the New Blank Document from the File menu. </p>

<p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s begin by identifying some of the main elements of the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word screen. The first thing you notice when you open the program is a big, white, vertical rectangle on a light blue background (depending on your system settings, your screen colors may differ slightly). This is your paper or <em>Document</em>, awaiting your brilliant thoughts and ideas! Click in this white box and you will see a small, vertical, black blinking bar. This is your <em>cursor</em>, and when you type, letters and numbers will appear on the screen wherever your cursor is located. </p>

<p class="media">Media not working on mobile? Try opening this eBook on your desktop or laptop computer.</p>
</div>

<h2 class="h2">Ruler and Margins </h2>


<p class="txt">Just above your document and also to the left of your paper is a <em>ruler</em> that is divided into numbered inches (the smallest marks are at &#8539;-inch intervals). If you do not see a ruler in your document, click on the View menu Ruler to make the rulers appear. A standard piece of paper is 8.5 inches from left to right and 11 inches from top to bottom. The Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word ruler guides show you exactly where you are typing on this standard-sized paper. The rulers can also be used to set your <em>margins</em>, which define where you can and cannot type on your paper. On the top ruler guide, you will notice that roughly the first inch is lightly shaded. This is your leftmost margin. Everything in white is your active paper where you can type. The rightmost margin is the shaded section at the end of the ruler. This is an easy way for you to adjust the margins of the paper. Click your mouse on the margin indicator and then drag it to the location you desire. The margins can also be changed in the Layout Ribbon. </p>



<h2 class="h2">Zoom </h2>


<p class="txt">At the very bottom of the screen, you will find other important information. On the left, you will see what page number you are currently working on, as well as how many total pages are in your document. To the right of that is a count of the total number of words. Then, moving all the way to the bottom right of the screen, you will see a &ldquo;100%&rdquo; with a sliding bar. This is how you <em>zoom</em> in and out of your paper. If you slide the bar to the right, the percentage of zoom increases, displaying your document at a much more detailed level. It is like moving your face very close to a book in real life. If you want to see it from farther away, slide the bar toward the left end. There is no correct number here, so experiment with it and see where this zoom is the most comfortable place for you to edit and write in your document. </p>




<h2 class="h2">Ribbons </h2>


<p class="txt">Take a look at the top of your screen, which is where you will find access to Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word&rsquo;s powerful features. The top bar is known as the <em>ribbon</em>, which changes when you select any of the seven main tabs or menu options (Home, Layout, Document Elements, Tables, Charts, SmartArt, and Review). </p>


<p class="txt">With a general understanding of the Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word screen behind us, we are now ready to look at what we can do with it. </p>

</div>
 <div class="section-body">



<p class="txt">The very top bar of the screen is the <em>Quick Access Toolbar</em>, where your most frequent tasks can be placed, and they do not change when you adjust the ribbons. Take a look at some of the icons there now. One of the first is an icon of an old 3.5-inch floppy disk, and when you click it, you will save your document. Near the middle of the toolbar is a curved arrow pointing left; this is the Undo button. Type some text, delete it, and then select the Undo button to see what happens. If you change your mind and really want to keep what you undid, then you can always select the Redo icon (the curved arrow that is pointing right). </p>

<p class="media">Media not working on mobile? Try opening this eBook on your desktop or laptop computer.</p>
</div>     

<h2 class="h2">Scrapbook (aka the Clipboard) </h2>


<p class="txt">If you look at the Quick Access Toolbar, you will note it is divided into sections. The Scrapbook (Clipboard for those who use Windows<Sup>&reg;</Sup>) is for &ldquo;cutting and pasting,&rdquo; which is a genericterm that describes what you do when you want to copy text or an image from one placeand paste it somewhere else. Remember, you never have to retype something to move it.Copy and paste it! </p>


<p class="txt">After you type in some text, highlight a portion of it by clicking and holding the mouse button and moving it over the text you want to copy. If you want to cut it (the scissor icon), select the scissors, and the text disappears but is not really gone. It has been copied to the Scrapbook. Now, if you want to paste it to a different part of your document, simply move your cursor there and select the large Paste button within the toolbar. The Command-C keyboard combination (holding down the Command key and typing C) will also copy text. Command-V will paste it. </p>


<p class="txt">But suppose for a moment that we do not have ready access to a mouse to perform work with the Clipboard section. No worries! We can use the keyboard to achieve the same result. For example, to perform a cut-and-paste operation, open a Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word document and type the letters A, C, and B, in that order. Then, using your keyboard arrow keys, move the cursor next to the letter C. Hold down the Shift key and move the cursor over the letter C to select it. Then press the Command-X keyboard combination by holding down the Command key and typing X. Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will remove the letter C from the document and copy it to the Clipboard. Then move the cursor to the right of the letter B. Press a space character and then press the Command-V keyboard combination. Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will copy the letter C from the Clipboard back into your document, putting the letters A, B, and C in order. </p>



<h2 class="h2">Find and Replace </h2>


<p class="txt">The rightmost area of the Quick Access Toolbar is the search section. When you have a very long document and you want to search for a specific word or phrase, select this, and Micro-soft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will find it for you. An even more powerful feature is the Replace option, which you access by clicking the down arrow. Let&rsquo;s say you realized that you mistyped an author&rsquo;s name many times in a document. You should not try to change all of these yourself; instead, let Microsoft<Sup>&reg; </Sup>Word do it. If his name was &ldquo;John Reed&rdquo; and you accidentally called him &ldquo;John Read,&rdquo; click the down arrow next to the search dialog box and select Replace, enter &ldquo;John Read,&rdquo; select the Replace tab, and type &ldquo;John Reed&rdquo; in the Replace With box. Finally, select Replace All, and Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word fixes your entire document. </p>

</div>

<h2 class="h2">Font </h2>


<p class="txt">The first area of the Home Ribbon is the Font section. The word &ldquo;font&rdquo; means the style and size of the text you are using in your document. There are lots of different font styles, and you can combine as many as you like on a page. To see all of them, select the drop-down arrow next to the current font name. Find what you like, select it, and you will start typing in this font. The font <em>point</em> size determines how large the text is, and the default is the number 12. The larger the number, the bigger the font. Under these options are important icons. The <strong>B </strong>icon enables you to put text in boldface, the <em>I</em> stands for italics, and the <U>U</U> will let you underline words. You can also change the text color by selecting the down arrow next to the A with a red bar under it. Find a color you like, select it, and the highlighted text in your document changes to that color. </p>


<a id="p241"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Paragraph </h2>


<p class="txt">The next area of the Home Ribbon is the Paragraph section. At the top, you will find three important icons that enable you to use outlines. Highlight the text you have written in your document and click each of these items to see what happens. This is a great feature for taking notes or planning out a final paper for a course. Under those are buttons to &ldquo;justify&rdquo; your text. The first is the Left Justify, which is what you will use most of the time. This will keep a straight left margin, and when you type and get to the end of a line, the computer will wrap the final word down to the next line. There is no need to hyphenate words in this scenario. The second icon is Center Justify. Use this to center text on your screen. The third is Right Justify, where everything typed will line up along a straight right margin. The final option here is simply called Justify. This is for when you want to align text between the left and right margins, to make it look like a published book. </p>




<h3 class="h3">Paragraph Indenting and Spacing </h3>

<p class="txt">When you work with paragraphs of text, there will be times when you want to control the indentation, spacing, and so on. To do so, click your mouse in the paragraph you want to format and then select the Line Spacing icon and choose Line Spacing Options. Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word, in turn, will display a dialog box with which you can control the paragraph settings. There is an Indentation option, which will change a single paragraph. </p>




<h3 class="h3">Sorting </h3>

<p class="txt">One final icon to note in this section is the Sort icon, which has an A and Z on it. This is a great feature when you are alphabetizing a list of names, such as when you are building a bibliography. If you have lots of authors listed and they are not in alphabetical order, highlight them, select this button, and Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word will organize for you. Numbers can also be sorted. </p>


<h2 class="h2">Styles </h2>


<p class="txt">Also within the Home Ribbon is the Styles section. All of your text can be assigned different styles, and the default is called <em>Normal</em>. There are lots of different options. For example, if you want to have a dramatic title for your paper, go to your first page, highlight your title, and select the Title style. Or, if you are writing a paper with subheadings, you can do the same thing for added emphasis. Highlight your subsection name and then select one of the heading styles. </p>



<h2 class="h2">Inserting Clip Art and Pictures </h2>


<p class="txt">The Insert section is a fun area in the Home Ribbon with which you can enliven your document with graphics and pictures. Using the Picture icon, you can direct Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word to open a window within which you can search for photos on your computer that you want to place in your document. Find an image you want to insert into your document, click it, and there it is. Using the Picture icon pull-down menu, you can direct Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> Word to insert clip art, which includes thousands of free cartoons and other images from Microsoft<Sup>&reg;</Sup> that you can use to illustrate your ideas. The Shape icon lets you build your own simple graphics. Clicking on it reveals a drop-down box in which you can select lines, arrows, basic shapes (circles, squares, etc.), callouts, and stars. The final icon in this section is Text Box, which lets you position a special box within your document, such as a sidebar in which you can type and later format text. </p>


<a id="p242"></a>

<h2 class="h2">Page Themes </h2>


<p class="txt">The Themes section lets you quickly make changes to the appearance of your document. This section will only make changes to your document if you already have Styles selected with different headers. Once you have Styles applied and you select the Theme icon, you will find many different professional looks for your document. Just pass your mouse pointer over them and watch your document change. But remember, it will not do anything unless you have Styles already assigned.</p>
