				<p class="txt">Acting with integrity is a concept most people do automatically; it is a part of who they are as people. Integrity essentially means doing the right thing and is a way to engage with others in all aspects of our lives. In an academic setting, acting with integrity tends to more specifically focus on how students interact with faculty and peers as well as how they approach and complete their work. Practicing integrity in an academic setting also helps you recognize unreliable sources for research to keep you out of unintentional trouble and makes you a more critical thinker, consumer, and citizen. Sometimes, especially early in the college experience, students are not as clear on or familiar with what it means to have academic integrity. If you are ever unsure, it is best to ask before you assume. Acting without integrity, even unintentionally, can lead to serious academic and even legal consequences. </p>

		<p class="txt">The academic community believes that one of the goals of an institution of higher learning is to strengthen honesty and responsibility among its members. To this end, colleges and universities emphasize a commitment to <strong>academic integrity</strong>, a moral code that emphasizes sound judgment and a personal sense of ethical responsibility. Maintaining your academic integrity will earn you the respect of your instructors and classmates. Scholars throughout the world and across time periods uphold academic integrity so that when we read something from a scholar, we can trust that the writer has integrity and is not intentionally leading us astray. Research certainly evolves, and new generations develop new and improved theories that may counter older writings, but academic integrity means that scholars write truthfully with the materials they have at the time. </p>

		<h2 class="h2">Academic Honesty</h2>       

		<p class="txt"><strong>Academic honesty</strong> is a code of conduct that ensures student work is original and ethical; it involves transparently acknowledging the ideas and works of others. Any attempts to deceive to meet academic requirements violate the code of conduct. Universities take such issues very seriously. Students are responsible for their conduct throughout their entire academic career. They remain responsible for each and every choice they make in college and are often held accountable for their behavior long after graduation. A single dishonest act can negatively impact the rest of your life. Conversely, consistently honest acts will positively impact your life, in school and beyond. </p>       

		<p class="txt">It is usually easy to distinguish between honest and dishonest behavior. Other times, however, the lines are blurry. Real-life circumstances can tempt students to cross the line and make bad choices. Consider each of the following ways in which academic honesty could be compromised. </p>

		<a id="p171"></a>
		<h3 class="h3">Honest Mistakes</h3>       

		<p class="txt">New students can make honest mistakes. A novice writer might inadvertently omit an in-text citation or misplace quotation marks. Similarly, you might consider an idea to be general knowledge, or something everyone reasonably knows. For instance, it is general knowledge that George Washington was the first president of the United States. However, if the paragraph you write about this general idea uses exact phrases you read from a column by a history professor, you must use proper citation. Even if you did not copy every word, you still have to give credit to the original author who created those succinct explanations. If you are ever in doubt about whether you need to cite a source, go ahead and cite it. Ideally, you would not make such mistakes, but if you do, make sure to learn from them. Errors and mistakes should not be repeated. If you find out you have unintentionally done something dishonest, pay attention. Speak up if you do not understand what went wrong. You cannot learn from a mistake if you do not realize what it was! </p>

		<p class="txt">Students must take the time to read and write carefully so that they convey information ethically. Remember, you alone are responsible for the integrity of your work. Pay close attention in class, and use the feedback you receive to improve your work. Forgive yourself if you make an honest mistake, but make every effort to ensure you do not make the same mistake again. </p>

		</figure>

		<h3 class="h3">Fabrication</h3>       

		<p class="txt"><strong>Fabrication</strong> is the intentional falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise. If you invent information, misrepresent ideas, or lie about your research, you are guilty of fabrication. Make the effort to conduct proper research, read sources carefully, take good notes, and remain honest throughout the writing process. If you do not understand the information in a source or have not read it yourself, do not cite it as a source in your work. Remember, you must represent information accurately and also identify where you retrieved it. </p>       

		<p class="txt">If you do not fully understand information but try to use it anyway, you may misrepresent it or commit fabrication. Some information is difficult to grasp, but adopting a growth mindset, putting in the extra effort, and being willing to reach out for help can be very useful. If information is difficult, take extra time to understand it, or find another credible source that presents similar information in a more understandable way. </p>       

		<p class="txt">Fabricating sources and hoping an instructor will not notice is unethical and dishonest. Remember that your professors are experts in their fields and likely have previously read the sources you are finding in your research. To avoid fabrication and all the negative consequences of this unethical practice, reach out to a librarian for assistance and use outlines to help you identify specific subtopics and claims in your draft that may need more support from research. </p>

		<a id="p172"></a>
		<h3 class="h3">Plagiarism</h3>       

		<p class="txt"><strong>Plagiarism</strong> occurs when ideas or words from an outside source are used without proper attribution. The source of information and ideas must always be cited according to the style guide your professor specified for the assignment. Even if you summarize or restate what you&rsquo;ve read in your own words, you must still cite and acknowledge the source. Direct quotes must be cited and properly formatted with quotation marks or as a block quote. Your audience must always be able to distinguish your thoughts and words from the work of others. Learning how to make this connection between your voice and the correctly cited material of other voices smoothly and clearly is a critical component of college-level writing. Table 11.1 includes common types of plagiarism that all students must avoid. </p>

		<p class="txt">Use the following tips to help you avoid plagiarism in your academic work. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
		<li class="li_text"><strong>Plan accordingly.</strong> In many cases, students accidentally or intentionally plagiarize because they are under pressure to meet a deadline and have not taken the time to do proper research, think about the assignment, or write a draft or two. Allowing yourself enough time to complete the assignment will reduce your stress and decrease the chance of your seeking desperate measures. Schedule a few hours each day to devote to a writing assignment in the same way you would for helping your children with homework, preparing dinner, running an errand, or completing a task at work. </li>

		<li class="li_text"><strong>Read carefully and keep good notes.</strong> You should always make an effort to understand the text that you are reading. Keeping good notes is one way to do this. Underline sections you don&rsquo;t understand and look up terms and phrases that are new to you. Always keep notes of where you found your information. You might even use different-color highlighter pens, develop a simple coding system, or make a two-column list to differentiate between your ideas and someone else&rsquo;s. </li>

		<li class="li_text"><strong>Learn to paraphrase and summarize.</strong> Put new ideas into your own words, change the sentence structure, or use synonyms, but always credit the source. Even though you are putting someone else&rsquo;s ideas into your own words, those ideas still belong to someone else, so it&rsquo;s necessary to provide a paper trail, if you will, to avoid plagiarism. </li>

		<li class="li_text"><a id="p173"></a><strong>Ask an instructor, a writing tutor, or a librarian.</strong> Don&rsquo;t forget that your instructor, writing tutor, and librarian are excellent sources of information. They can help you understand what counts as plagiarism and may even have their own strategies for avoiding plagiarism. Reading and writing don&rsquo;t have to be solitary activities. Never feel embarrassed or afraid to ask questions. Plagiarism is common and can easily be avoided if you know what to do and who to talk to. </li>

		<li class="li_text"><strong>When in doubt, cite it.</strong> Regardless of the formatting style required by your institution, always give credit to your source by including the name of the author (if it is known), the title of the work, and the page on which the quote was found. The full bibliographic information will be found at the end of your paper on a reference or works cited page. Make a list of all the sources that you use with this information. Remember: It&rsquo;s better to be safe up front than sorry later. </li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="h3">Beg, Borrow, Buy</h3>

		<p class="txt">Most students complete their own assignments and do the work for themselves. Students who rise to meet challenges, put in effort, and complete their own coursework are the ones who truly learn and find success. Occasionally, a student is tempted to beg for, borrow, or buy work completed by someone else. Clearly, such behavior is dishonest and unethical. Student writers can easily decide never to beg for a paper, borrow work from someone else, or buy coursework to submit as their own. Sometimes, however, it can be difficult to prevent others from begging for, borrowing, buying, or outright stealing your work. <em>Borrowing</em> in this context is a misnomer. In the true sense of the word, when you borrow something, you fully intend to give it back in as close to the same condition it was in when you took possession of it. So, you can borrow someone&rsquo;s car, for instance, but you can&rsquo;t borrow a tissue or chewing gum. Likewise, you cannot ethically borrow someone&rsquo;s ideas for a bit to complete an assignment or text&mdash;even if your friend says it&rsquo;s okay to reuse an old exam. </p>

		<p class="txt">Unfortunately, there are many predatory companies looking to take advantage of students, particularly students who attend online classes. Some websites present themselves as &ldquo;study&rdquo; websites while actually offering complete cheating resources for those willing to pay the price; others sell papers and discussion posts &agrave; la carte. Even social media sites such as Facebook can be riddled with offers to join study groups or get university-specific assistance online&mdash;but these offers are often actually well-disguised cheating sites. These offers can seem helpful to a student who is stressed, behind schedule, unmotivated, confused, or lacking in confidence. However, students who use a cheating service are only cheating themselves. They will lose money, will not learn, and eventually will be caught in an unethical position with significant online evidence of cheating. Despite the promises that manipulative companies make, universities continue to adapt to meet this challenge. Students who purchase papers will be caught and face strict penalties that are not worth what may seem like an easy way to get through a difficult assignment or course. </p>

		<p class="txt">Some companies pretend to offer free services such as grammar- or plagiarism-checking. However, when their software scans your paper, it keeps a copy of your work to sell online. Your work can be taken and sold for a profit without your knowledge. The best way to avoid trouble is to steer clear of any online &ldquo;tutoring&rdquo; or &ldquo;scanning&rdquo; service. Only use services offered directly through the university or recommended by university writing center tutors or librarians. </p>

		<a id="p174"></a>
		<h2 class="h2">Consequences of Academic Dishonesty </h2>       

		<p class="txt">Academic dishonesty undermines the bonds of trust and personal responsibility between and among students and faculty, weakens the credibility of the academic enterprise, and defrauds those who believe in the value and integrity of an academic degree. All universities and colleges therefore have policies identifying the consequences for academic dishonesty. Depending on the institution and the severity of the case, these policies can range from receiving a failing grade on the assignment to dismissal from the school. In some extreme cases a degree may be retracted after the student has already graduated. </p>       

		<p class="txt">When a student is suspected of any type of academic dishonesty, usually the faculty, dean, and committee responsible for upholding student community standards are notified. If the student feels that this accusation is unjust, they will be given a chance to refute the charges. The student must prove that the work is original. Students who have maintained practices of academic integrity, such as keeping detailed notes of research and citations throughout the writing process, are more likely to be able to defend themselves successfully. If a charge of academic dishonesty cannot be refuted, it may seriously tarnish the student&rsquo;s record and may even follow the student throughout their scholastic or professional career. </p>

	</div>   

    <div class="section-body">

		<p class="txt">In the 1960s Canadian theorist Marshall McLuhan recognized that technology and media allowed people to share ideas and interests in ways that were previously unknown. McLuhan (1962) coined the term &ldquo;global village&rdquo; to describe how we are connected with others through technology. McLuhan, of course, wrote long before the Internet had been invented, but he recognized the fact that when we engage with other people, no matter the context, we have shared rights and responsibilities. A digital citizen can be defined as a person who uses digital resources to engage in society (Mossberger et al., 2008). </p>       

		<p class="txt">The International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE) has developed standards for identifying a good digital student-citizen. The society defines digital citizenship among students in the following way: &ldquo;Students understand human, cultural, and societal issues related to technology and practice legal and ethical behavior&rdquo; (ISTE, 2007, p. 2). Good digital student-citizens, in the ISTE&rsquo;s (2007) view, conform to the following four actions. </p>

		<ol class="nl">
			<li class="li_text">Advocate and practice safe, legal, and responsible use of information and technology.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Exhibit a positive attitude toward using technology that supports collaboration, learning, and productivity.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Demonstrate personal responsibility for lifelong learning.</li>
			<li class="li_text">Exhibit leadership for digital citizenship. (p. 2) </li>
		</ol>       

		<p class="txt">What type of digital citizen are you? Do you meet the criteria listed? In what areas could you improve to be a better digital citizen? </p>

		<a id="p175"></a>
		<h2 class="h2">Practicing Online Etiquette </h2>       

		<p class="txt">In any society, having good manners and being polite are important to ensure that people respect one another and treat others appropriately. As a good digital citizen, you must also practice good manners. Over the past few years, a system of online etiquette has evolved to determine what is considered polite and professional behavior when using digital resources. </p>       

		<p class="txt">In the physical world, etiquette includes unwritten rules of good behavior such as holding the door open for the person entering a building behind you, not shouting or being rude in public, and showing respect for your colleagues. Online, similar rules are important to maintain a positive shared environment. Digital citizens are careful about not only what they say online but how they say it. One of the biggest problems with online communication is interpreting the writer&rsquo;s tone. What we think is short, sweet, and to the point, other people might interpret as rude, abrupt, or condescending. This same potential for misinterpretation is why online discussions shouldn&rsquo;t contain messages in all capital letters, which can come across as shouting, or be filled with abbreviations or emoticons, which are fine in casual texts and emails but may be seen as too informal in an academic setting. Always reread what you write before posting online to reduce the likelihood that what you have written will be misunderstood. </p>       

		<p class="txt">The following is a brief list of ground rules for communicating in any online environment. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Always avoid offensive language, and reread what you write so it is unlikely to be interpreted as offensive. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Never share personal information or material about other people. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Never distribute pornographic or slanderous material. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Don&rsquo;t engage in flaming, a term that describes an increasingly intense and vicious debate. If it appears that a discussion is headed in this direction, simply stop. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Remember the Golden Rule: Treat people the way you would like to be treated. </li>
		</ul>       

		<p class="txt">In addition to these communication guidelines, you should also think about how you communicate in a video setting. You don&rsquo;t need to be nervous about being on-screen, but you do need to remember that others can see you, just as in a face-to-face encounter. Here are some video communication suggestions. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Wear clothes! You may be able to get away with going barefoot, but make sure your clothing is appropriate for others to see as you participate in your meeting or study session. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Ensure your system&rsquo;s microphone and camera are functioning properly before the session begins so you don&rsquo;t delay the start of the videoconference. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Look around at your background to make sure it is at least neat and is also free from distractions that others may have a difficult time ignoring. You may want to include a virtual background&mdash; available in many video communication systems&mdash;or an old-fashioned screen or sheet set up behind you. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Eliminate as many noise distractions as you can before participating in the video session; turn off your music, don&rsquo;t type unless you are muted (if that is allowed), and ask others around you not to come into your video session. </li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="h2">Evaluating Sources of Information </h2>       

		<p class="txt">The explosive growth and use of the Internet in the 21st century has had a profound effect on how people access, interpret, and use information. People turn to the Internet to help them find information for everything from the location of restaurants, to instructions on starting their own business, to possible reasons for that curious rash on their big toe. In addition, of course, students turn to the Internet to find resources for their academic papers (Head, 2013). </p>       

		<p class="txt">Just as people are able to explore and discover overwhelming amounts of data and information on the Internet, they are also able to create new information quickly and easily by publishing their work online. This ease of publishing by anyone, while good for self-expression and the sharing of ideas, has implications for the reliability of what can be found on the Internet. When anyone can publish anything on the Internet, a great deal of unreliable and subjective information is created. </p>       

		<p class="txt">By the same token, more and more entities (professional organizations, academic journals, and government departments) that are considered highly authoritative are publishing on the Internet. How do you know whether the information is sound? Being able to evaluate information found on the Internet is absolutely critical not only for your academic life but also for your workplace and personal life (International Reading Association, 2009; Leu et al., 2011). </p>

		<p class="txt">The CRAAP test is a method that you can use to help evaluate information from both print and digital sources while in search of the truth. Developed by the Meriam Library at California State University, Chico, the CRAAP test is a list of questions that you can use to evaluate a source&rsquo;s currency, relevance, authority, accuracy, and purpose (Table 11.2). When used in conjunction with your critical thinking skills, the CRAAP test can be an effective method for determining the validity of a resource. </p>

        <h4 class="aside_title"><strong>Communication Skills: Using Sources as Support</strong></h4>
        <div class="aside_content">
			
			<p class="txt">The global community of scholars is a tight-knit group working together on projects, research, and innovative designs. They cooperate, collaborate, and share information to move their disciplines ahead. By choosing to attend college, you are joining this group. One of the most effective ways that scholars share information is through writing about their research findings in journal articles and presenting at professional conferences. Once these findings are published, you can join the rest of the community to use this information for your own reports and research. The quotations and paraphrases you pull out can support your ideas or even serve as a counterargument to the position you are making. All you have to do to have full access to this wealth of information is to cite the source correctly. You need to give that original author credit for the ideas in the source, in the same way you would want others to give you credit for your own original ideas. Otherwise, you are claiming those words or ideas are your own, and you are stealing the credit for them from the author.</p>

			<p class="txt">This restriction on citing sources appropriately is certainly not only for students; your professors also cite sources correctly because they understand how important it is to respect the work scholars are conducting. Disciplines have different style guides to help with the logistics of how to cite sources and what needs to be in a citation; these guides include the Modern Language Association (MLA) handbook, the Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA), and the Associated Press (AP) Stylebook, as well as many other specific guidebooks. Check with your professors to determine which style guide you need to follow for using sources as support in your writing.</p>

		<p class="txt">The community of scholars, to which you now belong, is a brilliant group of thinkers, scientists, artists, writers, dancers, scientists, engineers, and creators. They are passionate about their disciplines and want others to be equally passionate and excited about that field. You can hear it in some presentations and pick up on the thrill of innovation and discovery when you read some academic articles. Because scholars are so invested in their work, they have very serious rules of ethical conduct. Researchers who spend years tweaking a new design do not accept that someone else can come in and take credit for that research. You will feel the same way when you are in your chosen profession. As you begin your academic journey, make ethical behavior central to all your courses. Don&rsquo;t be caught off guard by unintentional plagiarism or seemingly innocent offers to assist you with academic work. Know the rules and follow them. You don&rsquo;t need to spend all the time, money, and effort you will put into your college experience to cheat and lie. You can do that for free, but why would you? You have goals to improve your life through higher education; maybe your goal is to pursue an advanced degree, or perhaps you want to earn more money to provide for your family or even be a role model to others. When you act with integrity, you and those around you can be proud of the hard work you did to succeed in college. Furthermore, when you act with integrity, you truly become a member of the upstanding community of scholars who strive to innovate and improve lives. </p>
