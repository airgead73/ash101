			<p class="txt">Have you ever heard someone reference &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; with the implication that college is separate from the real world? In some ways the college experience is unique. You&rsquo;re often surrounded by like-minded people with similar interests. While attending college, you have clear connections to supportive individuals who can provide you information, mentorship, and direction. You also have a long-term goal (a college degree) that is already broken down into smaller steps (a series of courses) for you. It is easy to recognize that these same conditions may not exist outside of college, and you may have personally had a job or even a family experience that has confirmed that &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; is, in fact, different from college. But the phrase is also often meant to convey that when a student encounters &ldquo;the real world,&rdquo; they will be startled or experience a wake-up call. It implies that they are unprepared, and this is definitely not the case! If you have already been working in a job or pursuing a career and are now returning to college, it&rsquo;s certain that you will agree. </p>

			<p class="txt">College provides you with an introduction to the technical skills required to enter a career or take a career to the next level, the transferable skills necessary to communicate and effectively interact with others, and the confidence to set and manage your own goals and see them through. While you will likely encounter much more diversity outside of college in terms of race, age, and experience, among other things, college prepares you to think critically about your own assumptions and acknowledge others&rsquo; experiences. While you may not have as many individuals intervening to ensure your success outside of college, college prepares you to build your professional network of resources beyond the school. And though your goals and action steps to accomplish them may not be as defined for you outside of college, college prepares you with the skills to manage your own plan as you move forward. </p>

			<p class="txt">This chapter specifically and practically addresses the college-to-career transition, drawing from the assumption that college and &ldquo;the real world&rdquo; are not separate experiences but rather are very relevantly intertwined. In this chapter you will learn definitions of college and career readiness and will consider your own readiness. You will learn to utilize your goal-setting and planning skills to construct a personal development plan. You will also consider, beyond the examples provided in this introduction, the ways in which college&mdash;and an academic major in particular&mdash;prepares you for a career. </p>

		<p class="txt">Knowing what you truly want to gain from your college experience is the first step toward achieving it. But reaching your goals doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean you are college and career ready. </p>

		<p class="txt">What does it mean to be ready for college and a career? In general, you are a college- and career-ready student if you have gained the necessary knowledge, skills, and professional behaviors to achieve at least one of the following: </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">earn a certificate or degree in college </li>
			<li class="li_text">participate in career training </li>
			<li class="li_text">enter the workplace and succeed </li>
		</ul>

		<p class="txt">For instance, if you are studying for a skilled trade license in college, or perhaps pursuing a bachelor of arts degree, you are college ready when you have the reading, writing, mathematics, social, and critical thinking skills to qualify for and succeed in the academic program of your choice. </p>

		<a id="p185"></a>
		<p class="txt">Similarly, you are a career-ready student if you have the necessary knowledge and technical skills needed to be employed in your desired field. For example, if you are a college student ready to be a nurse, you possess the knowledge and skill needed to secure an entry-level nursing position, and you also possess required licensing. </p>

		<aside class="aside color-2">
			<h4 class="aside_title">Try It: College and Career Readiness in Your State</h4>
			<div class="aside_content">

			<p class="txt">Where are you on the readiness scale? You can find out how your state measures readiness by visiting the College and Career Readiness and Success Center of the American Institutes for Research website at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://ccrscenter.org/ccrs-landscape/state-profile">https://ccrscenter.org/ccrs-landscape/state-profile</a>. There you will find an interactive state map, which leads you to definitions of college and career readiness for your state. The website also provides a variety of metrics to assess readiness and information about programs and structures in place to help both students and educators. You can also compare states across one or more of these categories. </p>
			
			</div>
		</aside>

		<p class="txt">As you have read in previous chapters, in order to succeed, you must believe in your ability to succeed&mdash;a belief known as self-efficacy. While considering your college and career readiness in terms of skills, it&rsquo;s also important to remember that mindset is key. To take action toward a goal and persist through challenges in order to achieve it, you first must believe that you&rsquo;re capable of it. Self-efficacy is thus the primer, or base layer, on which you build the necessary skills for readiness. </p>

    <div class="section-body">

		<p class="txt">Personal development is a lifelong effort of self-improvement. It involves dedication to improving self-awareness and developing talents, relationships, and even an overall sense of identity. Personal development leads to internal growth as well as external achievements. A <strong>personal development plan (PDP)</strong> is the road map to these individual successes that includes the steps you need to take and the resources you&rsquo;ll need to get there. </p>

		<h2 class="h2">What Is a PDP? </h2>

		<p class="txt">A PDP is an actual written or typed document. It might be handwritten in a journal, typed into a work document or spreadsheet, organized into an online or written planner, or even displayed on a corkboard or whiteboard. Regardless of where the PDP is written, the purpose of writing it is to help you focus your awareness and attention on pursuing the interests and building the skills that will support your goals. Seeing your PDP on a regular basis will serve as a reminder of the path you&rsquo;re on and the progress you&rsquo;re making, so it&rsquo;s important to keep your PDP in a place where you will see it or intentionally access it each day. </p>

		<a id="p186"></a>
		<h3 class="h3">What&rsquo;s Included in a PDP? </h3>

		<p class="txt">A PDP often includes goals and action steps across all domains of your life. While much of your reading has focused on academic and career goals, a PDP may also include goals related to relationships, physical health and wellness, spirituality, mental health, contributions (such as community service or financial giving), finances, and even goals related to hobbies or learning about interests outside of your career. </p>

		<p class="txt">In addition to goals in these different areas, a PDP includes the specific steps you will need to take to achieve your goals. In considering these steps, it is useful to try to foresee any challenges or obstacles you might face and to consider any resources or supports you might need to overcome those challenges. It is also important to plan the strategies and tools you will use to monitor and measure progress toward your goals to ensure you&rsquo;re on track or to recognize when changes may need to be made either in your actions or to the plan itself. </p>

		<h3 class="h3">Six Steps to Create Your PDP </h3>

		<p class="txt">Following the six steps outlined in this section will help you create your own PDP. </p>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Step 1: Consider your values first.</strong> You&rsquo;ll recall the importance of values from the earlier discussion of goal setting. If your values do not align with your goals, you will be less likely to achieve them. Your values are critical to maintaining motivation as you pursue your plan. </p>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Step 2: Write down your goals.</strong> Use the SMART goals model as you set your goals to ensure they are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time bound. Setting SMART goals will help you make good decisions and plan goals that are actionable. </p>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Step 3: Determine how and when you will meet your goals.</strong> Working backward from the last step in your plan to the first step often helps you better understand the necessary actions and their likely timelines. Something that must be done before you can do the next thing is called a <em>prerequisite</em>. Recognizing prerequisite steps will help you order your action steps, predict challenges, and avoid frustration. </p>

		<a id="p187"></a>
		<p class="txt"><strong>Step 4: Evaluate your strengths and opportunities.</strong> Consider the skills that you already possess, as well as those that you might need to develop as you outline your prerequisite action steps. Because areas of strength often align with your developing interests and goals, you may want to pursue your strengths with greater focus. Looking for opportunities to practice, demonstrate to others, and further develop your strengths can help you grow your professional network, prepare for interviews, and further refine your goals. You may also want to note possible challenges alongside your action steps so that you can devote additional time to potential obstacles and seek support if necessary. If you already know that certain steps may require support (such as emotional or financial support, specific tutoring, or professional advice), you should make note of this in your plan as well. </p>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Step 5: Develop good habits.</strong> You may not be completing goals or action steps toward your goals every day, but you can create daily habits that support your development. Looking at your PDP each day is a good initial habit. Rather than pressing the snooze button each morning, you could stretch for 5 minutes while reflecting on your mindset for tackling your growth that day. Other daily habits may be dependent on your goals. An example might be making your coffee at home or bringing your lunch rather than buying these things each day if you&rsquo;re working toward specific financial goals. </p>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Step 6: Track your progress. </strong>As you write your plan, consider the strategy or tool that you will use to measure your progress. While whiteboards, journals, and spreadsheets provide a great way to organize your goals and measure your progress, apps such as Strides (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://www.stridesapp.com/">https://www.stridesapp.com/</a>) and Habitica (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://habitica.com/">https://habitica.com/</a>) can also be used to account for daily habits that help you progress toward or are distracting you from your goals. Regardless of where or how you track your progress, be sure to know how you will update your plan as you gain more information or if you encounter an unexpected delay or challenge. Then put that strategy into action: Check your plan regularly, note changes, and celebrate successes! </p>

		<h2 class="h2">The Benefits of Creating a PDP </h2>

		<p class="txt">A PDP helps you focus your energies, develop good habits, track your progress, achieve goals, and increase the quality of your life. By creating and following a PDP, you will find that you will become increasingly self-aware and self-reflective&mdash;qualities that improve both your well-being and your personal and professional relationships. </p>

		<p class="txt">Most importantly, with a PDP, you will become more intentional in your actions. People tend to waste their time when they&rsquo;re not certain what they should be doing at any given moment. Imagine the time that is wasted across a lifetime without goals and direction. If you have a PDP, then you&rsquo;ll know what you can be doing at any given moment to work toward your goals. This is not to say that you&rsquo;ll always be working and never take breaks; rather, you&rsquo;ll be more intentional about taking breaks that are restful (and maybe contribute to wellness goals!) and make better use of your time while working. In short, a PDP helps you create a life of purpose. </p>

			<p class="caption">Your college major sets you on a career path with the knowledge and experience you&rsquo;ll need to be successful.</p>
			</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<p class="txt">Your academic major&mdash;usually just called &ldquo;your major&rdquo;&mdash;is the academic discipline you commit to as an undergraduate student. It&rsquo;s an area you specialize in, such as accounting, criminal justice, sociology, or early childhood education. When you successfully complete the required courses in your major, you qualify for a degree. </p>

		<p class="txt">Selecting a college major is important because it&rsquo;s a defining and organizing feature of your undergraduate degree. Ultimately, your major should provide you with the knowledge, skills, attitudes, and/or behaviors you need to fulfill your college goals and objectives. Additionally, the college major you choose will likely help you develop the knowledge and experience you need to start your career. </p>

		<a id="p188"></a>
		<p class="txt">If you have not yet selected a major or are still seeking confirmation that you&rsquo;ve selected the best major for your goals, the following tips and actions can help guide your consideration. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Seek inspiration. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Consider everything. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Identify existing talents and interests. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Take classes to help discover new talents and interests. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Make use of available academic and career resources. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Ask teachers, your academic counselor, and family and friends about your strengths. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Do an in-depth exploration of careers that might interest you. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Go on informational interviews with people in careers that interest you. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Narrow your choices by deciding what you <em>don&rsquo;t</em> like. </li>
		</ul>

		<p class="txt">Selecting your major can be both one of the most exciting and one of the most nerve-wracking tasks you are asked to perform as a college student. So many decisions are tied to it. But if you have good guidance, patience, and enthusiasm, the process is easier. Your major isn&rsquo;t going to define your life, but choosing one that interests you will make your college and career-planning experiences much more rewarding. </p>

		<h2 class="h2">Does My Major Really Matter? </h2>

		<p class="txt">There are few topics about college that create more controversy than &ldquo;Does your major really matter to your career?&rdquo; Many people think it does; others think it&rsquo;s not so important. Who is right? And who gets to weigh in? Also, how do you measure whether something &ldquo;matters&rdquo;&mdash;by salary, happiness, personal satisfaction? </p>

		<p class="txt">It may be difficult to say for sure whether your major truly matters to your career. Your college major and the career you ultimately pursue are not necessarily correlated. Consider the following data on college majors. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Roughly 33% of students enrolled in a bachelor&rsquo;s degree program change their major at least once during their time in college (National Center for Education Statistics, 2017).</li>
			<li class="li_text">Most majors lead to a wide variety of opportunities rather than to one specific career, although some majors do indeed lead to specific careers. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Many students say that the skills they gain in college will be useful on the job no matter what they major in. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Only 27% of college graduates end up taking jobs directly related to their majors (Fain, 2019). </li>
			<li class="li_text">Career planning for most undergraduates focuses on developing general, transferable skills like communication, time management, critical thinking, digital literacy, problem solving, and teamwork, because these are skills that employers want (Brooks, 2019). </li>
			<li class="li_text">Many or most jobs that exist today will be very different 10 years from now (van Eerd &amp; Guo, 2020). </li>
		</ul>

		<a id="p189"></a>
		<p class="txt">It&rsquo;s also important to talk about financial considerations in choosing a major. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Any major you choose will likely benefit you. On average, workers with a bachelor&rsquo;s degree earn $461 more each week than workers who never attended college (Torpey, 2018). </li>
			<li class="li_text">STEM jobs&mdash;those in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics&mdash;are typically among the highest paying jobs (National Association of Colleges and Employers [NACE], 2019). If you major in any of these areas, you may be more likely to earn a higher salary. </li>
			<li class="li_text">Even though humanities and social sciences students may earn less money right after college, they may earn more by the time they reach their peak salary than students who had STEM majors (Deming, 2019). </li>
		</ul>

		<p class="txt">The best guidance on choosing a major and connecting it with a career may be to get good academic and career advice and select a major that reflects your greatest interests. If you don&rsquo;t like law or medicine but you major in it because of a certain salary expectation, you may later find yourself in an unrelated job that brings you greater satisfaction&mdash;even if the salary is lower. This is your time and your tuition money, so be sure to consider all of your goals, academic and beyond, when deciding on a major and planning your career. </p>

		<h2 class="h2">Sources for Choosing a Major and Career </h2>

		<p class="txt">Your journey from your major to your career may be a straight line that connects the dots between today and your future, or it may resemble a twisted road with curves, bumps, hurdles, and alternate routes. </p>

		<p class="txt">To help you navigate your pathway to career success, take advantage of all the resources available to you. Your college, your community, and the wider body of higher education institutions and organizations have many tools to help you with career development. Be sure to take advantage of the following resources. </p>

		<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text"><strong>College course catalog:</strong> Course catalogs are typically rich with information that can spark ideas and inspiration for your major and your career. </li>
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Faculty and academic advisors at your college:</strong> Many college professors are also practitioners in their fields and can share insights with you about related professions. </li>
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Fellow students:</strong> Many of your classmates, especially those who share your major, may have had experiences that can inform and enlighten you&mdash;for instance, an internship with an employer or a job interview with someone who could be contacted for more information. </li>
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Students who have graduated:</strong> Most colleges and universities have active alumni programs with networking resources that can help you make important decisions. </li>
			<li class="li_text"><strong>Your family and social communities:</strong> Contact friends and family members who can weigh in with their thoughts and experience. </li>
			<li class="li_text"><strong>A career center:</strong> Professionals in career centers have a wealth of information to share with you&mdash;they&rsquo;re also very good at listening and can act as a sounding board for you to try out your ideas. </li>

		<p class="txt">What is the difference between a job and a career? Do you plan to use college to help you seek one or the other? </p>

		<p class="txt">There is no right or wrong answer, because motivations for being in college are so varied and different for each student. But you can take maximum advantage of your time in college if you develop a clear plan for what you want to accomplish. Table 12.2 shows some differences between a job and a career. </p>

					<td><strong>Definitions</strong> </td>
					<td>A job refers to the work a person performs for a living. It can also refer to a specific task done as part of the routine of one&rsquo;s occupation. A person canbegin a job by becoming an employee, volunteering, starting a business, or becoming a parent. </td>
					<td>A career is an occupation (or series of jobs) that you undertake for a significant period of time in your life&mdash;perhaps 5 or 10 years or more. A career typically provides you with opportunities to advance your skills and positions. </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
					<td><strong>Requirements</strong> </td>
					<td>A job you accept with an employer does not necessarily require special education or training. Sometimes you can get needed learning &ldquo;on the job.&rdquo; </td>
					<td>A career usually requires special learning&mdash;perhaps certification or a specific degree. </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
					<td><a id="p191"></a><strong>Risk taking</strong> </td>
					<td>Because jobs can often be more easily obtained, they may seem like a less risky means to an income. However, jobs require less technical skill, so there are often many people who can replace you in a position. This high turnover rate in jobs, with many people coming and going, can mean that a job actually involves more risk than an investment in a career. </td>
					<td>A career can also have risk, but because entering a career involves having certain skills and qualifications, there are often fewer people in the hiring pool. In today&rsquo;s world, employees need to continually learn new skills and adapt to changes in order to stay employed. Entrepreneurial careers, such as starting your own business, can have more risks than some other careers. Many people thrive on risk taking, though, and may achieve higher gains. It all depends on your definition of success. </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
					<td><strong>Duration </strong></td>
					<td>The duration of a job may range from an hour (in the case of odd jobs, for example) to a lifetime. Generally, though, a job is shorter term. </td>
					<td>A career is typically a long-term pursuit. </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
					<td><strong>Income</strong> </td>
					<td>Jobs that are not career oriented may not pay as well as career-oriented positions. Jobs often pay an hourly wage and may or may not offer benefits like health insurance. </td>
					<td>Career-oriented positions generally offer an annual salary versus a wage. Career-oriented positions may also offer appealing benefits, like health insurance and retirement. </td>
					</tr>

					<tr>
					<td><strong>Satisfaction and contributing to society</strong></td>
					<td>Many jobs are important to society, but some may not bring high levels of personal satisfaction.</td>
					<td>Careers allow you to invest time and energy in honing your crafts and experiencing personal satisfaction. Career pursuits may include making contributions to society.</td>

		<p class="txt">In summary, a job lets you enjoy at least a minimal level of financial security, and it requires you to show up and do what is required of you. In exchange, you get paid. </p>

		<p class="txt">A career, on the other hand, is more of a means of achieving personal fulfillment through the positions you hold. In a career, your jobs tend to follow a sequence that leads to increasing mastery, professional development, and personal and financial satisfaction. A career requires planning, knowledge, and skills, too. If it is to be a fulfilling career, it requires that you bring into play your full set of analytical, critical, and creative thinking skills. You will be called on in a career to make informed decisions that will affect your life in both the short term and the long term. </p>

		<h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>

		<p class="txt">This chapter provided an overview of the transition from college to career. The chapter opened with a discussion of college and career readiness, and you were asked to consider the skill building and mindset necessary to complete a college degree and pursue a related career pathway. Planning for this transition involves understanding the intended connections between your academic major and career goals. As shared in this chapter, however, your selection of academic major may not entirely identify and shape your career. </p>

		<a id="p192"></a>
		<p class="txt">In addition to preparing you with a credential and the introductory technical skills useful for entry into a job or career field, college teaches you the networking skills and transferable &ldquo;soft skills&rdquo; that provide further opportunity as you determine what you want to do and who you want to be as a professional. As you outline your personal development plan, keep in mind that goals, academic credentials, and even the plan itself are only as useful as the actions you take to see them through to completion. Even if you must revise your plan along the way, an action-oriented approach will help you find success as you transition from college to career. </p>
