<p class="tx">While goal setting often illustrates the best of our intentions, how we manage our time and energy can sometimes capture us at our worst. It has become rather glamorized in American culture to be constantly in motion, working many hours at being successful and accomplishing endless tasks regardless of the expense to our well-being, family, and rest. Busy-ness can appear successful, but it is also a stressful state to maintain and may take time and focus away from our real priorities. </p>


<p class="tx">You&rsquo;ve surely heard people wish they had more time to accomplish both what they must do and what they would like to do, and perhaps you&rsquo;ve wished the same. In the absence of the ability to create time, it&rsquo;s important&mdash;particularly when adding new responsibilities&mdash;to develop good habits to make the best use of the time you do have.  </p>


<p class="tx">This chapter focuses on the strategies you can employ to better manage your energy and your time. You will learn how to create both a personal energy-management and a time-management plan, as well as how to recognize and avoid the pitfalls that can interrupt your workflow and cause you to waste time. Because a key part of managing your energy and time is balancing work and life, you will also learn some ways to ensure you&rsquo;re engaging in activities that bring you joy and rest.</p>

      <h1 class="h1"><span class="sec_number">2.1</span> <span class="sec_title">Creating a Personal Energy-Management Plan</span></h1>
    </div>


    <div class="section-body">
			<p class="txt">Have you ever tried to read a passage of a book or article, only to find that though your eyes were following the words, your mind was not able to concentrate on their meaning? Perhaps you read and reread, hoping to eventually glean something from the page. Or perhaps you continued through the passage just to complete the task of reading, whether you truly grasped the meaning or not. The act of getting something done does not always equate with doing that thing well. </p>


			<p class="txt">Comprehending reading, doing quality work, optimizing physical performance, and even actively listening to a family member or friend requires focus and concentration. You may notice, however, that your ability to concentrate may change throughout the course of a day, waxing and waning depending on the time of day, how well you have slept or eaten, and any other activities that are on your schedule or your mind. </p>


			<p class="txt">Whereas time continues outside of our control, your energy level is very much related to your individual patterns of thinking and behavior. Recognizing your personal energy rhythms and learning how to influence those patterns can help you better maximize your time and sustain your concentration to achieve higher quality work, better relationships, and a better sense of overall wellness. The following sections address the three primary aspects of energy-management&mdash;physical, emotional, and mental energy&mdash;that will help you formulate a personal energy-management plan. </p>



			<h2 class="h2">Physical Energy</h2>

			<p class="txt">Do you feel tired during the midmorning or shortly after lunch? Do you notice that you&rsquo;re more productive first thing in the morning or perhaps later in the evening? Such changes in your energy cycle are not actually limited to being defined as a &ldquo;morning person&rdquo; or a &ldquo;night owl.&rdquo; Your physical energy cycles throughout the day in 90- to 120-minute periods. These cycles are called <em>ultradian rhythms</em>, and they allow your body and brain to rest between periods of higher intensity (Schwartz &amp; McCarthy, 2007). The day, therefore, is not a marathon but a series of smaller periods of higher level brain activity and rest. Unfortunately, many people organize their days as marathons and then feel negatively when they fail to keep up with their own plans because their bodies require rest. With awareness, however, you can plan to maximize these cycles.</p>

<a id="p25"></a>
			<p class="txt">Athletes who are interested in achieving peak physical performance know to incorporate recovery such as stretching or engaging in less strenuous exercise. Doing this allows their muscles to recover and strengthen so that they can work harder when they are reengaged. Whether you define yourself as an athlete or not, your body also gives you many different signals that it is time to rest. Common signals include physical restlessness, yawning, hunger or a need to snack, and difficulty concentrating. Ignoring these signals does not help you become more productive; rather, it leads to increased exhaustion and even less productivity. It is very important both for your well-being and for the quality of your work to allow your brain to be unfocused and to take breaks for recovery and rest. If you discover yourself working toward a deadline but becoming unfocused, take a brief walk or a moment to stretch before returning to your work. Then work toward becoming more intentional in how you schedule important work. Try to align your work periods with the cycle of time when you&rsquo;re also feeling the most rested and alert. 	</p>


			<p class="txt">In addition to becoming more aware of your body&rsquo;s natural rhythms, you can also work toward maximizing your alertness and ability to concentrate by engaging in healthy behaviors. Getting good nutrition, refraining from alcohol, and exercising are among the best actions you can take to increase your physical energy. Sufficient, high-quality sleep is the absolute key to allowing both your body and mind to recover. Many people tend to reward their hard work throughout the day with staying up late to binge-watch shows and movies, but this reward will certainly impact the ability to focus the next day. Prioritize sleep and physical wellness, and you&rsquo;ll discover that your physical energy will increase.</p>



			<h2 class="h2">Emotional Energy</h2>

			<p class="txt">A remnant from our early evolution, human bodies are readily prepared to respond to stressful situations with a heightened emotional reaction&mdash;a fight-or-flight response. This automated response prepares the body to react to danger, but it also makes it impossible to think clearly and reflectively. Physical and emotional stress can trigger this response, draining the body and mind of focus and energy. </p>


			<p class="txt">To minimize stress and sustain emotional energy, it&rsquo;s important to set healthy boundaries, such as refusing to say yes to additional tasks and activities when you really mean no. It&rsquo;s key to be authentic: Listen and be present for others, but also be honest about what drains your emotional energy. Invest time in doing things with others that positively energize you while avoiding unnecessary stress and drama. Recall that the ability to manage your emotions is directly linked with your ability to concentrate on important tasks. If you are drained or your emotions are heightened, you may need to take a break to reset your focus.  </p>

<a id="p26"></a>
			<h2 class="h2">Mental Energy</h2>

			  <figure class="photo-landscape"><img src="Images/2.1.jpg"

				  <p class="caption">Your ability to focus on a given task is directly tied to your physical, emotional, and mental energy levels.</p>
				</figcaption>
			  </figure>
		

			<p class="txt">Whereas physical and emotional energy are required to start on a task, mental energy is key to maintaining the motivation, willpower, focus, and creativity required to complete a task and complete it well. Just as with physical energy, the key to sustaining mental energy is to engage in shorter bursts of activity with periods of recovery in between. Unfortunately, many people never really give their minds adequate rest. They may break from important tasks only to keep their minds engaged in social media or other distractions that don&rsquo;t really allow the mind to recharge. You may have noticed that mindfulness exercises such as meditation have grown in mainstream popularity as technological distractions for our minds have increased. Mental energy requires the periodic escape that exercises such as meditation provide. Though it is more obvious to sit down or sleep to recharge physically, there are practices that can increase mental energy as well. </p>


			<p class="txt">The first practice that can help you increase and retain your mental energy is to spend less time making decisions (Bucci, 2020). If you tend to be an overthinker, you may be inclined to try to foresee every possible outcome of your decisions and balance out each of these possibilities in your decision-making process. If possible, try instead to limit your major decision making to planning sessions. In other words, devote time to intentional decision-making and planning rather than ruminating throughout the day. Trust that after you&rsquo;ve made a decision that&rsquo;s consistent with your values, it&rsquo;s a good decision. Also trust that if things do not go as planned, you are capable of managing change and problem solving if necessary. You&rsquo;ve learned these skills, so use them to keep your mind free of these doubts.</p>


			<p class="txt">The second practice is to give up on multitasking. People who admire the image of busy-ness tend to value multitasking since it looks very busy. In reality, our brains do not multitask but rather switch between activities. Some people can do this faster than others, but regardless of speed, it is nonetheless draining from mental energy stores. Instead of switching between activities, schedule similar tasks together in chunks. For example, rather than attempting to listen to an audio version of your textbook while writing an essay, schedule a block of time (or more than one per day) to listen to your book and then spend focused time on writing your essay. Focusing on one type of task for an extended period will help your mind work free of interruptions. You&rsquo;ll find that this practice makes it easier to control the breadth of what you&rsquo;re thinking about and focus more in depth on the task at hand. Reward yourself with restful breaks between periods of work to regain your mental energy. </p>


			<p class="txt">Finally, detox from your social media, unless of course social media is your job. Social media relates to multitasking but deserves its own mention because it is misunderstood to be a mindless task. You may think you are just scrolling and liking as you review your feeds, but&mdash;by design of the technology&mdash;your mind is actually very activated by social media engagement. When you check your social media accounts as you work or even as a rewarding break between work periods, you&rsquo;re not actually giving your mind the time it needs to recover. Instead of being constantly connected, set aside specific times to engage with your social media accounts, and ideally set aside times that are bookended by more restful mental breaks. For example, if you check your social media when you first wake up, when it&rsquo;s time to turn it off and move on, take a short walk, meditate, or listen to some music before moving on to your next mental task. Regardless of your specific approach, be careful not let your mental energy be taken prisoner by electronic notifications! </p>

			<h2 class="h2">Creating Your Energy-Management Plan</h2>

			<p class="txt">This section has focused on developing self-awareness of your physical, emotional, and mental energy, with the goal of maximizing your periods of greatest energy and focus. As you consider these recommendations for energy management, you may want to distill them into a plan. Keep the following tips in mind: </p>



			<ul class="bl">

			<li class="li_text">Know how your tasks relate to your values and goals. This alignment will keep you motivated through periods of lower energy levels.</li>

			<li class="li_text">Organize your tasks according to the type and level of energy that they require.</li>

			<li class="li_text">Be aware of your natural peak energy periods and schedule your most important work accordingly.</li>

			<li class="li_text">Know what is restful and rejuvenating to you and plan how you will spend your breaks accordingly.</li>

			<li class="li_text">Build energy-creating habits. Recall that habits take time to build, but once a habit forms, it requires less thought and less energy to repeat it. If your current habits drain you, then it will take thought and energy to change them, but it will be worth&nbsp;it!</li>

    </div>
   

    <div class="section-body">
 
<p class="txt">A very unfortunate but all-too-common situation in higher education is the danger students face from poor time management. Many college administrators who work directly with students are aware that a single mishap or a case of poor time management can set into motion a series of events that can seriously jeopardize a student&rsquo;s success. In some of the more extreme instances, the student may even fail to graduate because of it. To be successful in college, it&rsquo;s imperative to be able to effectively manage your time.</p>

      </div> 
        

<h2 class="h2">Preview Course Requirements </h2>

<p class="txt">One of the most important things you can do when creating a time-management plan as a student is preview the course requirements at the very start of your course. Unlike a job where you might clock in and clock out to know when you&rsquo;ve started and when you&rsquo;re done, it&rsquo;s harder to judge the time it will take to complete an assignment. Still, there are resources you can use to estimate and plan your time on task. The course guide, for example, includes the topics to be covered, due dates for all possible tasks and assignments, and grading rubrics for each assignment. You can preview the course topics and take note of material that is somewhat familiar to you already and may take a bit less time to study and learn, as well as material that is completely unfamiliar and may require more of your time. You can use assignment requirements and grading rubrics and work backward from due dates to start scheduling your time and make sure you allot enough time to prepare for and complete each task. </p>


<h3 class="h3">Understand the Requirements of Each Task</h3>
<p class="txt">Another way to plan for and manage the time you&rsquo;ll need to complete tasks is to understand the requirements of each task. If you just assume an upcoming assignment will only take an hour, you may decide to put it off until shortly before it is due. However, your assumption could be disastrous if you find, once you read over the requirements and begin the assignment, that there are several extra components that you did not account for and the time to complete it will be four times as long as you estimated. Because of situations like this, it is critically important to understand exactly what needs to be done in order to make sure you&rsquo;ve planned enough time to complete a task. </p>


<p class="txt">Just as you would take notes on your reading, jot down some notes as you review assignment requirements. Take particular notice of assignments with multiple components or multiple drafts. Create a task list of the stated requirements, and then add steps that might not be stated but are implied. For example, if you must write an essay including four sources on an historical event, it may be clear that you&rsquo;ll need to find four sources, read those sources, draft and proofread, and then add your list of references. It may be less obvious that in finding those four <em>good</em> sources, you&rsquo;ll likely need to skim through more than four sources to select the most relevant ones. Then you&rsquo;ll need to do a deeper reading (than your initial skim) of those four sources as you begin to formulate your essay. Perhaps you&rsquo;re a better writer when you first outline your essay and then follow that outline to complete your draft. It may not be a required component of the assignment, but it may be part of your personal process for completing it, and it will also take some time. Predicting this implied work and knowing the steps in your own work style will help you better predict sufficient time on task not only to complete your work but to complete it well.  </p>

<a id="p32"></a>

<h3 class="h3">Review the Grading Rubric</h3>
<p class="txt">Graded assignments will be assessed according to a <strong>rubric</strong>, or evaluation and scoring tool. Every assignment&rsquo;s rubric will be different. Before diving into any assignment, take a look at the grading rubric. Pay close attention to each criterion and notice the requirements at each performance level. You should use the highest performance level for each criterion as your guide in planning ahead to increase your chances of meeting the highest expectations. </p>


<p class="txt">Keep in mind that criteria for a grading rubric may be weighted (see Figure 2.1). Weighting means that some criteria may be worth a higher percentage of the final grade than others. Weighting may change from assignment to assignment. Always ask your instructor specific questions about the grading rubric. When you set out with a clear understanding of what is expected of you, you set yourself up for success.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Create a Schedule</h2>

<p class="txt">After assessing what you need to accomplish in your course, you&rsquo;ll want to think about how you might create a schedule for managing your time well going forward. The best schedules have some flexibility built into them, since unexpected situations and circumstances will likely arise during your time as a student.</p>


<p class="txt">Your schedule will be unique to you, depending on the level of detail you find helpful. There are some things&mdash;due dates and exam dates, for example&mdash;that should be included in your schedule no matter what. But you also might find it helpful to break down assignments into steps (or milestones) that you can schedule, as well.</p>


<p class="txt">Again, this is all about what works best for you. Do you want to keep a record of only the major deadlines you need to keep in mind? Or does it help you to plan out every day so you stay on track? Your answers to these questions will vary depending on the course, the complexity of your schedule, and your own personal preferences.</p>

<a id="p33"></a>


<p class="txt">Your schedule will also vary depending on the course you&rsquo;re taking. So pull out your syllabus and try to determine the rhythm of the class by looking at the following factors:</p>



<ul class="bl">

<li class="li_text">Will you have tests or exams in this course? When are those scheduled?</li>

<li class="li_text">Are there assignments and papers? When are those due?</li>

<li class="li_text">Are there any group or collaborative assignments? You&rsquo;ll want to pay particular attention to the timing of any assignment that requires you to work with others.</li>
</ul>

<p class="txt">You can find many useful resources online that will help you keep track of your schedule. Some are basic calendars like Google Calendar, iCal, or Outlook, and some calendar apps like iHomework are specialized for students.</p>


<p class="txt">Time management can be challenging for many college students, especially ones with lots of responsibilities outside of school, but creating a schedule can help you stay on top of your workload. You might decide to use a weekly or monthly schedule&mdash;or both. Whatever you choose, the following tips can help you design a smart schedule that&rsquo;s easy to follow and stick with. </p>


<h3 class="h3">Start With Fixed Time Commitments</h3>
<p class="txt">The first step in creating your schedule is to mark down the commitments that don&rsquo;t allow any flexibility. These include class meetings, work hours, appointments, assignment due dates, and so on. Capturing the &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; parts of your schedule can help you see where there are blocks of time that can be used for other activities. </p>


<h3 class="h3">Consider Your Studying and Homework Habits</h3>
<p class="txt">When are you most productive? Are you a morning person or a night owl? Block out time to study and work on assignments accordingly. You&rsquo;ll also want to factor in any resources you might need. For instance, if you prefer to study very late in the day, you may need to give yourself additional time to have any questions answered by a professor who tends to respond to emails in the morning.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Plan Ahead</h3>
<p class="txt">Even if you prefer weekly over monthly schedules, write reminders for yourself and keep track of any upcoming assignments, quizzes, projects, papers, or exams. You will also want to prepare for these assignments in advance. Most students eventually discover (the hard way) that cramming for exams the night before and waiting till the last minute to start on a paper is a poor strategy. Procrastination creates a lot of unnecessary stress, and the resulting final product&mdash;whether an exam, lab report, or paper&mdash;is rarely your best work. Try simple things to break down large tasks, such as setting aside an hour or so each day to work on them during the weeks leading up to the deadline. If you get stuck, get help from your instructor early, rather than waiting until the day before an assignment is due.</p>

<a id="p34"></a>

<h3 class="h3">Consider Leisure Time</h3>
<p class="txt">It might seem impossible to leave room in your schedule for fun activities, but every student needs and deserves to socialize and relax on a regular basis. Try to make this time something you look forward to and count on, and use it as a reward for getting things done. You might reserve every Friday or Saturday evening for going out with friends, for example. Or if a club you&rsquo;re interested in meets on Thursdays during a time you&rsquo;ve reserved for studying, try to reschedule your study time so you can do both. Consider the student schedule in Figure 2.2 as an example of how to put together a schedule that works for you.</p>

He also plays in a softball league that meets twice a week on Monday and Wednesday evenings, and he attends church on Sunday mornings. Because Kai&rsquo;s classes are online, he has the flexibility to choose when he is &ldquo;in the classroom.&rdquo; However, he still needs to schedule time to study and work on his assignments. Work, softball, and church all represent Kai&rsquo;s fixed time commitments. Once he adds those to his schedule, he can reflect on his studying habits and determine how he can realistically schedule time to study and do classwork.</p>

<h2 class="h2">Strategies for Time and Task Management</h2>

<p class="txt">Over the years, people have developed a number of different strategies to manage time and tasks. Some of the strategies have proved to be effective and helpful, while others have been deemed not as useful.</p>


<p class="txt">The good news is that the approaches that do not work very well or do not really help in managing time do not get passed along very often. But others, those which people find of value, do. What follows here are some unique strategies that have become staples of time management. While not everyone will find that each strategy works for them in every situation, enough people have found them beneficial to pass them along with high recommendations.</p>

<a id="p35"></a>

<h3 class="h3">Daily Top Three</h3>
<p class="txt">The idea behind the <strong>daily top three</strong> approach is that you determine which three things are the most important to finish that day, and these become the tasks that you complete. It is a very simple technique that is effective, because each day you are finishing tasks and removing them from your list. Even if you took one day off a week and completed no tasks on that particular day, a daily top-three strategy would have you finishing 18 tasks in the course of a single week. That is a good number of things crossed off your list.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Pomodoro Technique</h3>
<p class="txt">The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> was developed by Francesco Cirillo (2006/2018). The basic concept is to use a timer to set work intervals that are followed by a short break (see Figure 2.3). The intervals are usually about 25 minutes long and are called <em>pomodoros</em>, which comes from the Italian word for &ldquo;tomato&rdquo; because Cirillo used a tomato-shaped kitchen timer to keep track of the intervals.</p>


<p class="txt">In the original technique there are five steps:</p>

<ol class="nl">
<li class="nl">Decide on the task to be done.</li>
<li class="nl">Set the timer to the desired interval.</li>
<li class="nl">Work on the task.</li>
<li class="nl">When the timer goes off, put a check mark on a piece of paper. If you have fewer than four check marks, take a short break (3&ndash;5 minutes), then go to Step 1 or 2 (whichever is appropriate).</li>
<li class="nl">After four pomodoros, take a longer break (15&ndash;30 minutes), reset your check mark count to zero, and then go back to Step 1 or 2.</li>
</ol>

<p class="txt">There are several reasons this technique is deemed effective for many people. One is the benefit derived from quick cycles of work and short breaks: This helps reduce mental fatigue and the lack of productivity caused by it. Another is that it tends to encourage practitioners to break tasks down into things that can be completed in about 25 minutes, which is something that is usually manageable from the perspective of time available. It is much easier to squeeze in three 25-minute sessions of work time during the day than it is to set aside a 75-minute block of time.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Eat the Frog</h3>
<p class="txt">Of our three quick strategies, &ldquo;<strong>eat the frog</strong>&rdquo; probably has the strangest name and may not sound the most inviting. The name comes from the quote &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s your job to eat a frog, it&rsquo;s best to do it first thing in the morning. And if it&rsquo;s your job to eat two frogs, it&rsquo;s best to eat the biggest one first.&rdquo; The quote is often attributed to witty American author Mark Twain, though there is no real evidence supporting that attribution. However, <em>Eat That Frog</em> is the title of a best selling book by Brian Tracy (2017) that deals with time management and avoiding procrastination.</p>


<p class="txt">&ldquo;Eating the frog&rdquo; in terms of time and task management is based on the concept that if a person takes care of the biggest or most unpleasant task first, everything else will be easier after that.</p>


<p class="txt">Although stated in a humorous way, there is a good deal of truth in this. First, we greatly underestimate how much our performance can be impacted by worry. If you are continually distracted by anxiety over a task you are dreading, it can affect the task you are working on at the time. Second, not only will you have a sense of accomplishment and relief when the task you are concerned with is finished and out of the way, but other tasks will seem lighter and not as difficult.</p>


<h3 class="h3">Analyzing Your Schedule and Creating Time to Work</h3>
<p class="txt">Of all the strategies covered in this section, this one may require the most discipline, but it can also be the most beneficial in time management. The fact is most of us waste time throughout the day. Some of it is due to a lack of awareness, but it can also be caused by the constraints of our current schedules. An example of this is when we have 15 to 20 minutes before we must leave to go somewhere. We don&rsquo;t do anything with that time because we are focused on leaving or where we are going, and we might not be organized enough to accomplish something in that short of a time period. In fact, a good deal of our 24-hour days are spent a few minutes at a time waiting for the next thing scheduled to occur. These small units of time add up to a fair amount each day.</p>


<p class="txt">The intent of this strategy is to recapture those lost moments and use them to your advantage. This may take careful observation and consideration on your part, but the results of using this as a method of time management are more than worth the effort.</p>


<p class="txt">The first step is to look for those periods of time that are wasted or that can be repurposed. In order to identify them, you will need to pay attention to what you do throughout the day and how much time you spend doing it. The example of waiting for the next thing in your schedule has already been given, but there are many others. How much time do you spend in activities after you have really finished doing them but are still lingering because you have not begun to do something else (e.g., letting the next episode play while binge-watching, reading social media posts or waiting for someone to reply, surfing the Internet, etc.)? You might be surprised to learn how much time you use up each day by just adding a few unproductive minutes here and there.</p>

<a id="p37"></a>


<p class="txt">If you set a limit on how much time you spend on each activity, you might find that you can recapture time to do other things. An example of this would be limiting yourself to reading news for 30 minutes. Instead of reading the main things that interest you and then spending an additional amount of time just looking at things that you are only casually interested in, you could stop after a certain allotted period and use the extra time you have gained on something else.</p>


<p class="txt">After you identify periods of lost time, the next step will be to envision how you might restructure your activities to bring those extra minutes together into useful blocks of time. Compare the schedules in Figures 2.4 and 2.5 to see how Sarah restructures her Tuesday night schedule after identifying periods of lost time.</p>

While it may seem that there is very little room for improvement in her schedule without cutting out something she enjoys, limiting the amount of time she spends on each activity and rethinking how she goes about each task can make a significant difference.</p>

          <p class="caption">Sarah realizes that if she plans her meals for the week and prepares a list of items she needs at the store before Tuesday night, she can go directly from work to the store (instead of stopping home first to see what she needs) and would not spend as much time looking for meal inspiration in each aisle. She estimates she can save 20 minutes driving time and 30 minutes shopping time doing this. Sarah also decides that if she chats with friends while she prepares her dinner, she could save about 30 minutes later in the evening. These adjustments add 1 hour and 20 minutes back to her schedule without giving up things she needs to do or enjoys.</p>

    <div class="section-body">

		<p class="txt">Even with the best laid plans, poor work habits and distractions can lead to stress, frustration, and even delays in completing your education. Just as you may have competing values, you likely have conflicting responsibilities that can draw unexpectedly on your time. This next section addresses those time-management pitfalls that can be avoided, or at least predicted, so that you can better prepare to stick to your schedule and plans. </p>


		<p class="txt">As you begin to reflect on or experience your own time-management &ldquo;traps,&rdquo; keep in mind that scheduling and planning your time is often an exercise in trial and error. If you&rsquo;re seeing a pattern of pitfalls that cannot be avoided, rather than feel discouraged, make adjustments to your schedule and keep referring back to the following tips to help you stay focused. </p>



		<h2 class="h2">The High Cost of Poor Time Management</h2>

		<p class="txt">It&rsquo;s not just your academic performance that can be affected by cascading events that have a domino effect on your college path. And dropping out of school is not your only danger. There are other consequences that affect the financial cost to you as a student if your lack of time-management skills causes you to delay when you finish college.</p>


		<p class="txt">Based on independent research, <em>The Washington Post</em> article &ldquo;Spending a Few Extra Years in College May Cost You More Than You Think&rdquo; (Douglas-Gabriel, 2016) details the financial impact delaying graduation by two semesters can have on a student (see Table 2.1). According to the article, there is a significant cost associated with delaying graduation from college by only 1 year (by dropping and retaking courses, taking less than a full credit load, etc.). Not only will you pay for additional tuition, textbooks, and other fees associated with going to school, but if you are using student loans, you will also accumulate interest on those loans. </p>


		<p class="txt">In addition to those costs, <em>The Washington Post</em> article estimates that 1 year&rsquo;s delay of graduation can also cost you lost wages and lost retirement earnings. Measured by the financial cost to you, even a slight delay of graduation can have a serious impact.</p>

		<p class="txt">It is worth noting that any situation that brings about a delay in graduation has the potential to increase the cost of college. This also includes attending school on a part-time basis. While in some instances responsibilities may make it impossible to go to school full time, from a financial perspective you should do all you can to graduate as soon as you can.</p>


		<p class="txt">While it may not be possible to prevent life challenges while you are in college, you can do a great deal to prevent the chaos and the chain reaction of unfortunate events that they can cause. This can be accomplished through thoughtful prioritization and time-management efforts.</p>



		<h2 class="h2">Procrastination</h2>

		<p class="txt">Simply put, <strong>procrastination</strong> is the act of delaying a task that needs to be completed. It is something we all do to some extent. For most people, a little minor procrastination is not a cause for great concern. But there are situations in which procrastination can become a serious problem with a lot of risk, such as when it becomes a chronic habit, when there are a number of tasks to complete and little time in which to complete them, or when the task being avoided is very important.</p>


		<p class="txt">Because we all procrastinate from time to time, we usually do not give it much thought, let alone think about its causes or effects. Ironically, many of the psychological reasons we avoid a given task also keep us from understanding why procrastination can be extremely detrimental and in some cases difficult to overcome.</p>


		<p class="txt">To succeed at time management, you must understand some of the hurdles that may stand in your way. Procrastination is often one of the biggest. What follows is an overview of procrastination with a few suggestions on how to avoid it.</p>


		<h3 class="h3">Reasons Behind Procrastination</h3>
		<p class="txt">There are several reasons we procrastinate, and a few of them may be surprising. On the surface we often tell ourselves it is because the task is something we do not want to do, or we make excuses that there are other things more important to do first. In some cases this may be true, but there can be other contributors to procrastination that have their roots in our physical well-being or our own psychological motivations.</p>

<a id="p41"></a>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Lack of Energy</strong></p>


		<p class="txt">Sometimes we just do not feel up to a certain task. It might be due to discomfort, an illness, or just a lack of energy. If this is the case, it is important to identify the cause and remedy the situation. It could be something as simple as a lack of sleep or improper diet. Regardless, if a lack of energy is continually causing you to procrastinate to the point that you are beginning to feel stress over not getting things done, you should definitely assess the situation and address it.</p>


		<p class="txt"><strong>Lack of Focus</strong></p>


		<p class="txt">Much like having low physical energy, a lack of mental focus can be a cause of procrastination. This can be due to experiencing mental fatigue, being disorganized, or allowing yourself to be distracted by other things. Again, like low physical energy, this is something that may have further reaching effects in your life that go beyond the act of simply avoiding a task. If it is something that is recurring, you should properly assess the situation.</p>


		<p class="txt"><strong>Fear of Failure</strong></p>


		<p class="txt">This cause of procrastination is not one that many people are aware of, especially if they are the person avoiding tasks because of it. To put it in simple words, it is a bit of trickery we play on ourselves by avoiding a situation that makes us psychologically uncomfortable. Even though they may not be consciously aware of it, the person facing the task is afraid that they cannot do it or will not be able to do it well. If they fail at the task, it will make them appear incompetent to others or even to themselves. Where the self-trickery comes in is by avoiding the task. In the person&rsquo;s mind, they can rationalize that the reason they failed at the task was because they ran out of time to complete it, not that they were incapable of doing it in the first place.</p>


		<p class="txt">It is important to note that a fear of failure may not have anything to do with the actual ability of the person suffering from it. They could be quite capable of doing the task and performing well, but it is the fear that holds them back.</p>


		<h3 class="h3">Strategies for Overcoming Procrastination</h3>
		<p class="txt">Now that you understand a few of the major reasons for procrastination, let&rsquo;s look at methods to manage procrastination and get you on to completing your tasks</p>



		<ul class="bl">

		<li class="li_text"><strong>Get organized.</strong> The most effective way to combat procrastination is to be organized. Use time- and project-management strategies such as schedules, goal setting, and other techniques to get tasks accomplished in a timely manner.</li>

		<li class="li_text"><strong>Put aside distractions.</strong> Distractions are time killers and are also the primary way people procrastinate. It is too easy to play a video game a little while longer, check out social media, or finish watching a movie when avoiding a task. Putting aside distractions is one of the primary functions of setting priorities.</li>

		<li class="li_text"><strong>Reward yourself.</strong> Rewarding yourself for the completion of tasks or meeting goals is a good way to avoid procrastination. An example of this would be rewarding yourself with the time to watch a movie you would enjoy after you have finished the things you need to do.</li>

		<li class="li_text"><strong>Tell someone else.</strong> According to some researchers (Klein et al., 2020), we feel more compelled to do something if we tell someone we think highly of what we are going to do and when we are going to do it. It may be related to our need for approval from others, or it might just serve to set a level of commitment. Either way, it can help us stay on task and avoid procrastination&mdash;especially if we take our accountability to another person seriously enough to warrant contacting that person and apologizing for not doing what we said we were going to do.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2 class="h2">Multitasking</h2>

		<p class="txt"><strong>Multitasking</strong>&mdash;doing several things at the same time&mdash;has become a common word for describing what many of us do every day in the modern world. Our busy lifestyles and our ever-present devices suggest that many of us have become multitasking experts. But is multitasking real? Is it possible to do several things at the same time? Can we actually check Facebook, watch television, read a textbook, and write a paper at roughly the same time productively?</p>


		<h3 class="h3">Switching Tasks</h3>
		<p class="txt">Evidence suggests that multitasking is not, in fact, possible. Psychology research shows that we can attend to only one cognitive task at a time (Weinschenk, 2012). What we call multi-tasking is actually just switching back and forth between tasks quickly. This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a problem, but we lose time with each switch. The loss may only be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> of a second, but the time adds up. </p>


		<h3 class="h3">Busy Brains</h3>
		<p class="txt">Researchers have found that multitasking increases production of the stress hormone, cortisol, and the fight-or-flight hormone, adrenaline (Levitin, 2015). These hormone-level increases can cause the brain to literally overheat, which leads to foggy mental processing. Further, multitasking also taxes the prefrontal cortex, the part of the brain that integrates information. Your capacity for problem solving decreases with the number of tasks you try to perform at the same time.</p>


		<h3 class="h3">Personal Technology</h3>
		<p class="txt">The perceived need to multitask is driven largely by the technology takeover of recent years. Smartphones, email, social networking, and the like all make multitasking seem both necessary and possible. They all require switching in and out of a line of thinking. With these technologies, we face constant information overload and distraction.</p>


		<h3 class="h3">Becoming More Productive</h3>
		<p class="txt">So how can we become more productive with our time and energy, given our tendency to multitask? Consider these tips:</p>



		<ul class="bl">

		<li class="li_text">Try &ldquo;batch processing&rdquo;: Have set times during the day for checking and responding to emails.</li>

		<li class="li_text"><a id="p43"></a>Use concentrated time: Block off time for working on just one task. You may need to turn off your phone.</li>

		<li class="li_text">Do what&rsquo;s most important first: Make goals for the day and accomplish them. The sense of achievement can help you resist anxiety-driven multitasking.</li>
		</ul>

    </div>

  
    <div class="section-body">

			
		<p class="txt">Have you ever tried to grow a plant? Water it too much and you drown it. Too little water and it dries out. Give it too much light and it burns, but give it too little and it fails to flourish. You may know that plants need water, light, and soil to grow, but different plants require a differing balance of these to thrive. When considering how to balance personal life and obligations with the responsibilities of school, don&rsquo;t think of &ldquo;balance&rdquo; in terms of teetering on an edge; rather, think of it in terms of nurturing a plant: You need to find the right mix to sustain your growth. </p>


		<p class="txt">Earlier sections in this chapter have made note of the need to incorporate breaks for rest and personal interests, making the assumption that personal life provides a break from work. As you seek balance, however, it&rsquo;s important to acknowledge that your personal life may be filled with draining obligations and that school&mdash;by providing you a means to pursue your goals&mdash;may be your break. In other words, depending on your circumstances, school can add work to your list of responsibilities, or it can be the very valid excuse that you need to do something for yourself personally. In either case, it&rsquo;s important to find balance between what drains you and what sustains you. Reflect regularly on whether you&rsquo;re growing or whether you perhaps need to make a change to your own mix of soil, water, and light. </p>



		<h2 class="h2">Keep a Journal</h2>

		<p class="txt">Because balance is individual, reflection and self-awareness are key. As you begin to recognize your energy cycles and how they overlap with your personal life and schoolwork, you may want to keep a brief journal. Breaking old habits and forming new ones requires that you take note of what&rsquo;s not working for you, what is, and why. Memorializing these notes in a journal will help you recognize your existing patterns but will also help you celebrate when a change has had positive impact or take note of when you need to reevaluate. </p>

				</figcaption>
			  </figure>
		

		<p class="txt">When keeping a journal, whether in written or electronic form, you&rsquo;ll want to note what you did that day that worked for you and kept you focused and energized. You can even add emojis to your day&rsquo;s to-do list or calendar to remind yourself of how you felt physically, emotionally, and mentally as you engaged in that activity or task. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll note that you need to rearrange your schedule in the future to be better aligned with your energy level, or perhaps you enjoy a particular activity and actually require fewer breaks in the future. Summarize any patterns that you&rsquo;re noticing in your journal and then incorporate your knowledge of these patterns into your weekly or daily task planning. </p>


<a id="p44"></a>

		<h2 class="h2">Keep Your Schedule Updated</h2>

		<p class="txt">If you&rsquo;ve not kept a calendar in the past, you&rsquo;ll want to get one. Not only is it useful for planning your schoolwork and studying, it is also key for you to keep track of important dates and social events. As you add more deadlines and blocks of planned time to your schedule, you may find that you lose track of birthdays, anniversaries, or social invitations made in passing. Losing track of occasions that you would have acknowledged in the past will not only be frustrating to you but may cause emotional strain in your relationships with others. </p>


		<p class="txt">Even if you choose not to attend an event, recalling that it&rsquo;s occurring will allow you to send a quick message, like &ldquo;Hey, wish I could have made it today, but I hope you had a great time and I&rsquo;ll look forward to the next event with you!&rdquo; Sending a message similar to this one will help you remain connected by letting your friend or family member know, first, that you&rsquo;re thinking about them, and second, that the reason you can&rsquo;t join them is actually only temporary. Keeping your schedule updated is then about more than just managing your time&mdash;it&rsquo;s also about managing your relationships. </p>


		<p class="txt">While you consider others in your schedule, also remember to make and prioritize time for yourself, particularly for scheduling, planning, and reflecting or journaling. Set aside this time intentionally and make it a daily habit, perhaps while you have a morning coffee or before you go to bed (instead of watching &ldquo;just one more episode&rdquo; on your streaming service). </p>



		<h2 class="h2">Find Opportunities to Overlap</h2>

		<p class="txt">Recall the forewarning against multitasking in the moment, but find opportunities for overlap in your schedule. A major challenge in balancing life and school tends to be feeling as though you&rsquo;re failing to fulfill obligations to others in your life while tending to the responsibilities of school. Finding opportunities to overlap daily tasks, breaks, and even schoolwork with others can help incorporate your interaction with others back into your packed schedule. For example, if you&rsquo;re responsible for cooking, then ask others to cook with you. Maybe start a pillow fight as you make your bed. Moments of laughter during daily tasks will help you relax and feel connected with others. </p>


		<p class="txt">Let others know when you plan to take a break from your work, and then plan to take a walk or have a snack together. If there are children in your life, plan to spend a low-energy period recharging with some coloring or playing a low-stakes board game. Finally, if they work for you, engage in study strategies that incorporate others. Ask others to quiz you with flash cards. Discuss a concept you&rsquo;re learning to test your understanding of it. Perhaps read some literature aloud as if your home were a theater. You may be surprised to find that engaging others in what you&rsquo;re doing can help both parties feel more fulfilled than just trying to schedule separate times for school versus life. </p>



		<h2 class="h2">Communicate and Seek Support</h2>

		<p class="txt">The importance of communication and seeking support is reiterated throughout this and other chapters. Engaging others helps keep you accountable and on track. As it relates to balancing life and school, however, clear communication can also mean managing the expectations of others when you cannot find ways to overlap your time with them. Similarly, seeking their support may mean asking others to give you alone time to focus on your work. </p>

<a id="p45"></a>

		<p class="txt">Open early lines of communication by sharing your goals. Then keep others apprised of your schedule and needs. Let them know what you need from them in order to stay on track, even if it changes over time. Share when you&rsquo;ve planned time together so that they have something to look forward to with you. When you&rsquo;re struggling, let others know how they can help. Also, keep in mind and let others know that your goal does have a measurable end point. The schedule you&rsquo;re keeping now is not forever, and when you&rsquo;ve accomplished your goal you can celebrate together. </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>


<p class="txt">This chapter began by encouraging you to rethink busy-ness and be more intentional with your energy and time. As you undertake new goals, self-awareness and careful planning are key. The first section on energy-management planning is intended to help you begin to tune in to your natural energy rhythms. As you become more familiar with how to influence those cycles, you can also schedule your tasks to maximize periods of higher energy. </p>


<p class="txt">The next section discussed specific time-management strategies. Applying the practical strategies provided in this chapter will help you better manage your schedule and complete your task. Remember that time passes whether we use it well or not. In addition to careful planning, avoiding procrastination requires determination and commitment to your goals. </p>


<p class="txt">Finally, the chapter concluded with advice about how to balance your life with school. The analogy of the plant serves as a reminder that not every strategy (nor mix of water, light, and soil) will work for every person or individual situation. You will need to find the strategies that work best for you and create regular habits that will help you make the best use of your energy and time to meet your goals. </p>
