		<p class="txt">You likely have been reading for a long time, and that previous reading experience will help you transition into the complex tasks expected of you as a college student. While you may experience a great deal of pleasure learning new ideas in college, reading for academic success and reading to understand complex issues are not the same as leisure reading that does not demand your full attention. You may love to read science fiction or romance novels just before you fall asleep and don&rsquo;t much care if you doze off in the middle of a chapter. Even if you truly enjoy the writing, you are a passive observer of the world the novelist created. You are not reading these texts to analyze every bit of knowledge the writer presents. You are relaxing in the world of the novel for a few minutes at the end of your day, and you won&rsquo;t be quizzed on this content! </p>


		<p class="txt">When you read for your courses, however, you must take a different approach. You are reading for details and information that probably will take you more than a quick first reading to understand. You are looking for the main ideas, the key terms, the most significant ideas the chapter or selection has to offer. And then you are going to think about those ideas and compare them to other texts or ideas you may have in your notes from a lesson. This back-andforth exploration is what academic reading is all about. You are an active participant in the reading process, and as such, you need to hone your skills to get the most out of your limited time for reading. You must engage in deliberate strategies to help you make sense of what the reading material is about and to assist you in organizing your thoughts so you can return to your ideas for review. Reading is a circular process that allows you to return to contemplate ideas frequently as you add to your knowledge base. You may have noticed if you reread favorite stories or even watch movies more than once that you continue to pick up on nuances you may have missed the first time. That&rsquo;s what learning is all about. </p>

				<p class="txt"><strong>Active reading</strong> is a process of engaging with a text critically. As opposed to passive reading, whereby you take in information without really questioning or making connections with the text, active reading encourages you to think deeply about what you read. If you learn to become an effective active reader, you will be impressed with the results. Learning to become an active reader takes practice, but with time you will improve this crucial skill set. </p>

				<h2 class="h2">Annotating and Note-Taking </h2>

				<p class="txt"><strong>Annotating</strong> means writing a note, either in the margin of a text or on a separate document, that explains or comments on what you have read. Notes that help keep track of key ideas are called <em>annotations</em>. If you are using an ebook or reading an online assignment, you might use highlights and annotate electronically using digital highlighter and note-taking tools. When reading printed texts and assignments, read with a pen or pencil and highlighters at hand. If you are unsure what a paragraph or sentence means, mark it with a question mark. You can also indicate surprising moments in the text with an exclamation point. Another good practice is to respond to interesting sections of the text by writing down statements, questions, or ideas about them. </p>

<a id="p121"></a>

				<p class="txt">If you decide to use highlighting as part of annotating, you should do so sparingly and with a specific goal in mind. For example, you may find it helpful to use different color highlighters for different themes. Perhaps you notice that the ideas of nature and gender are traced throughout a text. You might use one color to mark where the topic of nature arises and a different color to mark where gender is discussed. This is a sound method for organizing annotations. Keep in mind that you don&rsquo;t need to mark everything; part of active reading is learning to distinguish between which material is important enough to annotate and which is less important. When you are finished with a text, the annotations act as a series of interactions between you and the text. </p>


				<p class="txt">It is perfectly normal to have initial reactions to a text when you read it for the first time. However, try to remain open minded. It is important to make every attempt to create an honest interpretation of the text that is well supported by what it says. Avoid immediately disagreeing with a text or assuming it is uninteresting&mdash;doing so will make it harder to understand. You might ask yourself, &ldquo;Would the author of the text consider this to be a fair interpretation?&rdquo; If the answer seems to be &ldquo;no,&rdquo; reread portions of the text where you may have become stuck. Depending on the assignment&rsquo;s requirements, you may want to do some additional research or reading. </p>


				<p class="txt">As you read, keep the assignment&rsquo;s learning outcomes in mind. As a careful reader, you should ask yourself the following questions. </p>


				<ul class="bl">
				<li class="li_text">Does this information answer the assignment prompt&rsquo;s question? </li>

				<li class="li_text">Do I need to know this information? </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">If the answers are &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; read the material carefully and annotate it in some way. Always read with a purpose, whether that is to answer questions an instructor has asked, to answer your own questions about the text, or to organize your thoughts for an assignment.</p>


				<p class="txt">Taking and reviewing your notes is covered in more detail in Chapter 9. </p>


				<h2 class="h2">Journaling and Reflecting </h2>

				<p class="txt">If, while reading, you identify certain page numbers or ideas that seem important, write them down in a reading journal where you can record your initial thoughts and impressions of a text. You can easily create a journal using a word processing document or a note-taking app, such as OneNote or Apple Notes. This journal will become useful later when you brainstorm ideas and outline possible main points for an assignment, such as the first draft of an essay. Active readers should especially note the elements of a text that are most interesting or that stand out in some way. Keeping this journal will also help you think about questions to ask in class about the text. The more you engage with the text, the stronger your understanding of it will be. Make sure to record the title of the passage you are reading, any relevant page or section numbers, and the date you are making the notes in your journal, so later you don&rsquo;t have to rely on your memory. </p>


				<p class="txt">Active readers note key phrases and terms and then reflect on them and consider their significance. Reflection leads to brainstorming, which yields ideas that might be used in a paper. Brainstorming is a necessary step that allows you to synthesize material and articulate what you are learning from it. </p>

<a id="p122"></a>

				<h2 class="h2">Reading Visuals </h2>

				<p class="txt">Many readings include graphics such as tables, illustrations, or charts; these visual representations make information more understandable. Whenever you encounter visuals in your reading assignments, take time to consider what the visual is telling you and how it contributes to your understanding of the material. What types of images does the material present? While a photograph may offer more direct insight into an event, a pie chart may offer an analysis of a set of factors. Tables, graphs, charts, photographs, paintings, posters, video clips,and other graphics impart information, clarify ideas for a reader, represent ideas that are hard to describe, or simply convey concepts that need additional support. Sometimes your memory of a graphic depiction of information can trigger you to recall more complex details about the idea. </p>


				<p class="txt">When reading visuals (such as Figure 8.1), ask yourself the following questions. </p>


				<ul class="bl">

				<li class="li_text"><strong>What can I see?</strong> When looking at a visual, take note of what components are present. Are there any symbols? Is there a key that explains those symbols? Are there labels? If the visual is a photograph or a video, who or what is represented? What are they doing? Can you tell who they are and why they are included? </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>What is the image trying to convey?</strong> Answering this question requires you to interpret the information the visual is presenting. In other words, you make meaning out of the components you identified when you asked yourself, &ldquo;What can I see?&rdquo;Is the intent of the visual to show an increase of a specific element over time? Is it an example of a person or place discussed in the text? </li>
				</ul>

				<h2 class="h2">Reading Systems </h2>

				<p class="txt">Active reading takes time and cannot be rushed. College students employ a number of reading systems, or specific methods of approaching reading, to help them make the most of the time they spend actively reading. This section covers only a portion of those systems, but no matter what system you adopt, devote time, attention, and effort to the process for the most effective results. </p>


				<h3 class="h3">SQ3R </h3>

				<p class="txt">One of the most popular systems for active reading is known as SQ3R, which is short for &ldquo;survey, question, read, recite, and review&rdquo; the steps in the system. This system is simple to follow and can significantly improve your understanding of what you read. </p>


				<ul class="bl">

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Survey:</strong> To survey means to preview information. Before reading a chapter, skim or flip through it and read the bold headings that divide the text into different sections. These headings show you how the chapter is organized and express the main ideas it will cover. As you survey the chapter, pay attention to any hints, tips, or other material shown in the margins or provided in hyperlinks. This text is specially formatted to make it stand out from the rest of the text; it usually summarizes major points or provides helpful information. Next, examine all graphs, pictures, diagrams, and tables. These serve to summarize information in a clear and concise way. Finally, read the introductory and summary paragraphs at the beginning and end of the chapter. These paragraphs indicate what to look for in the chapter and recap the most important information. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Question:</strong> After your survey, go back to the beginning of the chapter and start reading the headings. As you come to each chapter heading or subheading, change it to a question that features the words &ldquo;who,&rdquo; &ldquo;what,&rdquo; &ldquo;where,&rdquo; &ldquo;when,&rdquo; &ldquo;why,&rdquo; or &ldquo;how.&rdquo; For example, this chapter&rsquo;s title is &ldquo;Reading Strategies.&rdquo; If we change this heading to a question, it might read, &ldquo;What are reading strategies?&rdquo; As you read, you will look for information in the chapter that answers that question. Looking for answers to such questions is a form of engaging with the text, and doing so helps you create your own dialogue with it. There is no right or wrong way to form one of these questions. Just apply this method to each chapter heading and subheading as you come across it. Challenging yourself in this way will help you stay interested in what you are reading and improve your understanding of the text. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Read:</strong> Use the questions you created during the question stage to begin reading actively. Think about what the text means. Because you are reading for information that you may need to retrieve later&mdash; for either an exam or a written assignment&mdash;develop a system for recording information as you read it. Underline or highlight information that answers your question or that you think is important. Or you can use an asterisk (*), an exclamation point (!), or a question mark (?) to mark passages you think are particularly important to remember. </li>
				

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Recite:</strong> After you have finished reading a section of text, test whether you actually understand the material by trying to restate it. Reciting does not necessarily mean you say anything out loud. You can recite what you learned to yourself, silently. Or you might tell someone else what you learned, discuss it in a written post, or write a short paragraph in a notebook that summarizes the information. However you choose to &ldquo;recite,&rdquo; it is important that you recap what you learned in some way. Think of reciting as a type of self-test to reinforce material in your mind. If you do not clearly understand what you read, go back and review it again. Or ask your instructor or other students to help clarify the meaning. </li>
				

				<li class="li_text"><a id="p124"></a><strong>Review:</strong> Finally, review the most important information by going back and looking over what you underlined, marked, or highlighted. Reread or type up your handwritten notes. Imagine the sort of quiz questions you might be asked on the material and make sure you have answers to them. When you are finished reading the assigned text, summarize the main points or ideas you think the text is suggesting. Your ultimate goal is to gain a sense of what is valuable in the text. </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">You can use the sample chart in Figure 8.2 to practice the SQ3R method yourself! </p>

      </div> 

				<h3 class="h3">S-RUN-R </h3>
				<p class="txt">S-RUN-R, short for &ldquo;survey, read, underline, notes, and review,&rdquo; is similar in approach to the SQ3R method. However, S-RUN-R breaks up the read step from SQ3R into three parts: read, underline, and notes. Since the survey and review steps are essentially the same as those in SQ3R, we will focus here on the read, underline, and notes steps. </p>


				<ul class="bl">
				<li class="li_text"><strong>Read:</strong> Write down the heading of the section you are about to read. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Underline:</strong> After you read the first paragraph in that section, underline or highlight the information you thought was important. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Notes:</strong> Next to the section heading, write down notes about that information you underlined or highlighted, summarizing it in your own words. </li>
				</ul>

<a id="p125"></a>

				<p class="txt">The S-RUN-R approach helps you create effective notes based on your reading selection. Later, when you don&rsquo;t have time to reread the entire selection, you can go to these abbreviated notes to recall the most important aspects of the chapter or passage. </p>


				
                <h3 class="h3">KWL</h3>

				<p class="txt">A graphic organizational reading system called KWL&mdash;know, want to know, learn&mdash;is another method you may find helpful. KWL is a way for you to identify what you may already know about a topic, what you want to know about that topic, and what you end up learning about that topic after reading. The system involves creating a chart with three columns labeled &ldquo;Know,&rdquo; &ldquo;Want to know,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Learn&rdquo; (see Figure 8.3). Before starting, write down the topic about which you are reading or the name of the article or chapter so you can remember what this chart is about when you go back to review. </p>


		        <ul class="bl">

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Know:</strong> Before you read anything in the passage, make a list of anything you already know about the topic in the first column of the KWL chart. For instance, if the chapter you&rsquo;re reading is about elephant conservation in Africa, you may note that you know elephants are mammals, they are large, and they have tusks. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Want to know:</strong> Still before reading anything, put in the second column anything you want to learn about the topic. For the previous example, you might list how long elephants live, how much they typically weigh, and what they eat. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Learn:</strong> As you read, take brief notes when you find the answer to one of your questions or a confirmation of what you already know about the topic. After you finish reading, note what you learned about the topic from the reading in the final column. </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">You may end up with more than one KWL chart for a reading selection if it covers multiple topics. Conversely, the reading passage may not cover everything you hoped to know once you read the selection. In this case you may need to do additional research to find that information.</p>

				<h3 class="h3">THIEVES </h3>
				<p class="txt">THIEVES is a prereading system that is intended to give the reader a preview of a full chapter or reading <em>before</em> reading it. Using the acronym &ldquo;THIEVES&rdquo; to remember the steps, you will focus on the title, headings, introduction, every first sentence in a paragraph, visuals and vocabulary, end-of-reading questions, and summary. </p>

<a id="p126"></a>

		        <ul class="bl">
				<li class="li_text"><strong>Title:</strong> Review the title and consider what the text will be about and whether you have any background knowledge on the topic. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Headings:</strong> Look over each of the headings and how they are organized: What are the main headings? What are the smaller topics covered under those headings? How do the topics relate to the bigger picture of the overall reading? </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Introduction:</strong> Read the introduction and reflect on what it tells you about what you will be reading. Consider whether you may already know anything about this topic. Does the introduction make you curious to know more? </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Every first sentence in a paragraph:</strong> Read the first sentence of each paragraph in the reading, then predict what else you think the reading will be about based on what you have read. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Visuals and vocabulary:</strong> Review any visuals, such as photos or figures, and consider what you can learn from them as you read. Also review any bolded terms of vocabulary lists. Are you familiar with these terms already? If not, can you understand their meaning by reading the surrounding content? </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>End-of-reading questions:</strong> Preview any questions at the end of the reading to learn what the chapter might be about and what the main takeaways may be. Keep these questions in mind as you read as a way to gauge your comprehension of the information covered. </li>

				<li class="li_text"><strong>Summary:</strong> Read the summary or concluding paragraph of the reading. What else can you learn about the reading from how the author ends it? What do you think the author&rsquo;s main point or idea will be? </li>
				</ul>

				<p class="txt">What you are doing with this reading system is taking full advantage of the strong organizational markers the reading selection already has in place. You can think of this approach as creating a sort of map you can use to guide you through the reading. This system is particularly useful for textbooks, websites, or longer selections that are divided up for ease of navigation. </p>

    </div>
   

    <div class="section-body">


			<p class="txt">One topic that often comes up when students discuss things about college life that surprised them is the amount of reading they have to do. Even if you like to read and always have a novel or two going, you likely will have to make some adjustments to your approach to reading to accommodate all the difficult material you need to process in college. If, on the other hand, you aren&rsquo;t crazy about reading, you are going to have to come to terms with the fact that you <em>will</em> read for almost every college class you take, so you will have to plan accordingly. Understanding what you need to read, scheduling adequate time for it, using effective reading habits and strategies, and bringing all your previous knowledge to bear to this important task will help you succeed in all your classes. One fact of life all college students need to recognize is that reading and rereading is a significant part of their study time. </p>


		    <h2 class="h2">Allowing Adequate Time for Reading </h2>

			<p class="txt">You should determine the reading requirements and expectations for every class as soon as possible. You also need to understand why you are reading the particular text you are assigned. Do you need to read closely for minute details that determine cause and effect? Or is your instructor asking you to skim several sources so you become more familiar with the topic? Knowing this reasoning will help you decide your timing, what notes to take, and how best to undertake the reading assignment. Whatever the reason for reading an assigned selection, don&rsquo;t underestimate the time it will take for you to pay attention to the task. Keep in mind that active reading takes far more time than casual skimming. </p>

<a id="p127"></a>

			<p class="txt">Depending on the makeup of your schedule, you may end up reading primary sources&mdash;such as legal documents, historic letters, or diaries&mdash;as well as textbooks, articles, and secondary sources, such as summaries or argumentative essays that use primary sources to stake a claim. You may also need to read current journalistic texts to stay current in local or global affairs. A realistic approach to scheduling your time to allow you to read and review all the reading you have for your courses will help you accomplish what can sometimes seem like an overwhelming task. </p>


			<p class="txt">When you allow adequate time in your hectic schedule for reading, you are investing in your own success. Reading isn&rsquo;t a magic pill, but it may seem like it when you consider all the benefits people reap from this ordinary practice. You can make time for reading in a number of ways that include determining your usual reading pace and speed and scheduling active reading sessions. </p>


			<h3 class="h3">Determining Reading Speed and Pacing </h3>

			<p class="txt">To determine your reading speed, select a section of text&mdash;passages in a textbook or pages in a novel. Time yourself reading that material for exactly 5 minutes and note how much reading you accomplished in that time. This could be either the number of pages you read or the number of words. Most textbooks and novels average about 300 words per page. Multiply the amount of reading (number of pages or words) you accomplished in 5 minutes by 12 to determine your average reading pace (5 times 12 equals 60 minutes, or 1 hour; see Table 8.1 for examples). Of course, your reading pace will be different and take longer if you are taking notes while you read, but this calculation of reading pace gives you a good way to estimate your reading speed that you can adapt to other forms of reading. </p>

			 <p class="txt">So, for instance, if Marta is able to read 4 pages of a dense novel for her English class in 5 minutes, she should be able to read about 48 pages in 1 hour. Knowing this, Marta can accurately determine how much time she needs to devote to finishing the novel within a set amount of time, instead of just guessing. If the novel Marta is reading is 497 pages, then Marta would take the total page count (497) and divide that by her hourly reading rate (48 pages/hour) to determine that she needs about 10 to 11 hours overall. To finish the novel spread out over 2 weeks, Marta needs to read a little under an hour a day to accomplish this goal. </p>

<a id="p128"></a>

			<p class="txt">Calculating your reading rate in this manner does not take into account days when you&rsquo;re too distracted and you have to reread passages or days when you just aren&rsquo;t in the mood to read. And your reading rate will likely vary depending on how dense the content you&rsquo;re reading is (e.g., a complex textbook vs. a comic book). Your pace may slow down somewhat if you are not very interested in what the text is about. What this method will help you do is be realistic about your reading time as opposed to waging a guess based on nothing and then becoming worried when you have far more reading to finish than the time available. </p>


			<h3 class="h3">Scheduling Set Times for Active Reading </h3>

			<p class="txt">As we&rsquo;ve discussed in this chapter, active reading takes longer than reading through passages without stopping. As a scholar, you are actively engaging with the text by posing questions, seeking answers, and clarifying any confusing elements. Plan to spend at least twice as long to read actively than to read passages without taking notes or otherwise marking select elements of the text. </p>


			<p class="txt">To determine the amount of time you need for active reading, use the same calculations you used to determine your traditional reading speed and double it (see Table 8.2 for examples). Without keeping track of how much time you will need, you run the risk of having some weeks when you cannot possibly finish what you need to read. So take an overall approach to your reading assignments of knowing that some weeks will be heavier than others, and spread out your reading time accordingly. </p>

			<h2 class="h2">Practicing Recursive Reading Strategies </h2>

			<p class="txt">For all the reading you will do for your college courses, you will end up doing even more <em>rereading</em>. It may be the same content, but you may be reading the passage more than once to detect the emphasis the writer places on one aspect of the topic or how frequently the writer dismisses a significant counterargument. This rereading is called <strong>recursive reading</strong>. </p>


			<p class="txt">For most of what you read at the college level, you are trying to make sense of the text for a specific purpose&mdash;not just because the topic interests or entertains you. You need your full attention to decipher everything that&rsquo;s going on in complex reading material&mdash;and you even need to be considering what the writer of the piece may not be including and why. This is why reading for comprehension is recursive. </p>


			<p class="txt">Specifically, this boils down to seeing reading not as a formula but as a process that is far more circular than linear. You may read a selection from beginning to end, which is an excellent starting point, but for comprehension, you&rsquo;ll need to go back and reread passages to determine meaning and make connections between the reading and the bigger learning environment that led you to the selection&mdash;that may be a single course or a program in your college, or it may be the larger discipline, such as all biologists or the community of scholars studying beach erosion. Similar to the process of revising multiple drafts to end up with a well-written paper, recursive reading is a process of rereading to end up with a better understanding of a text. </p>

<a id="p129"></a>

			<p class="txt">Strong readers engage in numerous steps (see Figure 8.4). You may recognize some of these steps from the discussion of different reading systems earlier in this chapter. Though they do not always need to occur in this exact order, the steps for recursive reading include </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">bringing any prior knowledge about the topic to the reading session; </li>

			<li class="li_text">asking yourself pertinent questions, both orally and in writing, about the content you are reading; </li>

			<li class="li_text">inferring information from and/or finding implications in what you read; </li>

			<li class="li_text">learning unfamiliar discipline-specific terms; </li>

			<li class="li_text">evaluating what you are reading; and eventually, </li>

			<li class="li_text">applying what you&rsquo;re reading to other learning and life situations you encounter. </li>
			</ul>

			   </figure>

			
			
            <p class="txt">Let&rsquo;s break these steps into manageable chunks, because you are actually doing quite a lot when you read. </p>

<a id="p130"></a>
			
			<h3 class="h3">Accessing Prior Knowledge </h3>

			<p class="txt">When you read, you naturally think of anything else you may know about the topic, but when you read deliberately and actively, you make yourself more aware of accessing this prior knowledge. Have you ever watched a documentary about this topic? Did you study some aspect of it in another class? Do you have a hobby that is somehow connected to this material? All of these seemingly unrelated bits of knowledge will help you comprehend the topic more fully. If you can&rsquo;t come up with any prior knowledge, why do you think this is? Is the topic so obscure that it has never crossed your path? Is the topic related to innovative technology that is so new very few people are talking about it? This isn&rsquo;t exactly prior knowledge, but considering why this topic <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> on your radar can also help you understand it as you start your exploration. </p>



			  <figure class="photo-landscape"><img src="Images/8.1.jpg"

				  title="Question mark next to a pencil."
				  id="img8.1" />
				<figcaption>
				  <p class="cr">Akintevs/iStock/Getty Images Plus</p>
				  <p class="caption">Active reading involves asking and answering questions. Write your questions down and leave room to answer them.</p>
				</figcaption>
			  </figure>
		



			<h3 class="h3">Asking Questions </h3>
			<p class="txt">Humans are naturally curious beings. As you read actively, you should be asking questions about the topic you are reading. Don&rsquo;t just say the questions in your mind; write them down or even ask them out loud to yourself. You may ask: Why is this topic important? What is the relevance of this topic currently? Was this topic important a long time ago but irrelevant now? Why did my professor assign this reading? </p>


			<p class="txt">You need a place where you can actually write down these questions; a separate page in your notes is a good place to begin. If you are taking notes on your computer, start a new document and write down the questions. Leave some room to answer the questions as you read and again after you read. Make sure to label and date these hard copy or online notes so you can access them later when you need to review this information. </p>


			<h3 class="h3">Inferring and Implying </h3>
			<p class="txt">When you read, you can take the information on the page and infer, or conclude, responses to related challenges from evidence or from your own reasoning. You will likely be able to infer what material the professor will include on a quiz by taking good notes throughout the classes leading up to the quiz. Textbook writers include key words in bold or as headings so you know they are important. When you infer as you read, you are doing the same thing by figuring out what are the most important parts of the passage. </p>


			<p class="txt">Writers may imply information without directly stating a fact, for a variety of reasons. For example, a writer may not want to explicitly state a political bias but may imply or hint at their preference for one party or another. Sometimes a writer may literally say, &ldquo;This situation disappoints me,&rdquo; but usually, writers are more subtle than this and may include explanations about various scenarios that reveal this negative response. You have to read carefully to find implications because they are indirect, but watching for them will help you comprehend the whole meaning of a passage. </p>

<a id="p131"></a>
	
			<h3 class="h3">Learning Vocabulary </h3>
			<p class="txt">Vocabulary specific to certain disciplines helps practitioners in that field engage and communicate with each other. Few people beyond undertakers and archaeologists likely use the term &ldquo;sarcophagus&rdquo; in everyday communications, but for those disciplines, it is a meaningful distinction. Looking at the example, you can use context clues to figure out the meaning of the term &ldquo;sarcophagus&rdquo; because it is something undertakers and/or archaeologists would recognize. At the very least, you can guess that it has something to do with death. As a potential professional in the field you&rsquo;re studying, you need to know the lingo. You may already have a system in place to learn discipline-specific vocabulary, so use what you know works for you. Two strong strategies are to look up words in a dictionary (online or hard copy) to ensure you have the exact meaning for your discipline and to keep a dedicated list of words you see often in your reading. You can list the words with a short definition so you have a quick reference guide to help you learn the vocabulary. </p>


			<h3 class="h3">Evaluating </h3>
			<p class="txt">Intelligent people always question and evaluate. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they don&rsquo;t trust others; they just need verification of facts to understand a topic well. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to learn incomplete or incorrect information about a subject just because you didn&rsquo;t take the time to evaluate all the sources at your disposal. When early explorers were afraid to sail the world for fear of falling off the edge, they weren&rsquo;t stupid; they just didn&rsquo;t have all the necessary data to evaluate the situation. </p>


			<p class="txt">When you evaluate a text, you are seeking to understand the presented topic. Depending on how long the text is, you will perform a number of steps and repeat many of these steps to evaluate all the elements the author presents. When you evaluate a text, you need to do the following. </p>


			<ul class="bl">
			<li class="li_text">Scan the title and all headings.</li>

			<li class="li_text">Read through the entire passage fully. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Question what main point the author is making. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Decide who the audience is. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Identify what evidence/support the author uses. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Consider if the author presents a balanced perspective on the main point. </li>

			<li class="li_text">Recognize whether the author introduced any biases in the text. </li>
			</ul>

			<p class="txt">When you go through a text looking for each of these elements, you need to go beyond just answering the surface question; for instance, the audience may be a specific field of scientists, but could anyone else understand the text with some explanation? Why would that be important? </p>




			<h3 class="h3">Applying </h3>

			<p class="txt">When you learn something new, it always connects to other knowledge you already have. One challenge we have is applying new information. It may be interesting to know the distance to the moon, but how do we apply it to something we need to do? If your biology instructor asked you to list several challenges of colonizing Mars and you do not know much about that planet&rsquo;s exploration, you may be able to use your knowledge of how far Earth is from the moon to apply it to the new task. You may also have to read several other texts and conduct mathematical calculations in addition to reading graphs and charts to find this information. </p>

<a id="p132"></a>

			<p class="txt">That was the challenge the early space explorers faced along with myriad unknowns before space travel was a more regular occurrence. They had to take what they already knew and could study and read about and apply it to an unknown situation. These explorers wrote down their challenges, failures, and successes, and now scientists read those texts as part of the ever-growing body of knowledge about space travel. Application is a sophisticated level of thinking that helps turn theory into practice and challenges into successes. </p>

				<h2 class="h2">Reading for Key Words and Action Verbs </h2>

				<p class="txt">When you read your assignment instructions, create a list of key words and phrases&mdash;important nouns, verbs, adjectives, or adverbs that describe or explain the assignment requirements. This is one place in your study practice that you can use highlighting effectively. In your initial search and identification of key words and action verbs, you can quickly highlight one- and two-word phrases that you can go back to later to form your lists. </p>


				<p class="txt">Assignments require students to interpret action verbs, objectives, and assignment requirements. The learning outcomes established in your college courses and assignments will likely use specific verbs that explain what the assignment calls for. Table 8.3 describes what certain verbs mean and what they require of you in an assignment. Refer to Table 8.3 each time you receive an assignment. After you have identified an assignment&rsquo;s key words and phrases, locate the action verbs in this table. Underline or highlight them, then read the columns labeled &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; and &ldquo;Assignment requirements&rdquo; for each verb to determine what your instructor expects you to do. </p>

				<h2 class="h2">Understanding Discussion Questions and Written Assignments </h2>

				<p class="txt">Discussion questions and written assignments require you to read closely and focus on recurring concepts, themes, and problems that appear in the text. In fact, it is usually a good idea to read a text several times so you can trace details, concepts, and themes you may have missed on your first reading. Did you know that your instructors likely reread a text every single time they teach it? This is because active reading makes details clear, and a second reading also allows you to make many more connections than the first time you read. Especially with longer reading assignments, you cannot possibly remember every detail in the passage, so reading multiple times helps you digest different elements. Discussion and writing assignments have specific requirements that students also need to read carefully. Students often lose points on their discussion posts and papers because they do not respond to all the questions or points in the instructions or they fail to address all the required parts of the assignment. </p>

<a id="p134"></a>

				<h3 class="h3">Discussion Questions and Posts </h3>

				<p class="txt">If your course requires discussion posts, they likely are accompanied by specific guidelines. Familiarize yourself with these. If you have questions, do not hesitate to ask your instructor for clarification. Guidelines may include the following. </p>


				<ul class="bl">
				<li class="li_text">Read the discussion board requirements and your instructor&rsquo;s guidance thoroughly. </li>

				<li class="li_text">Make certain your post answers all questions and addresses all issues required by the assignment. </li>

				<li class="li_text">Be sure your initial post contributes to the topic. It should demonstrate that you have read, understood, and critically evaluated the topic. Give examples and cite specific sentences or paragraphs from the text or from outside research to support your statements. </li>

				<li class="li_text">Relate the topic to your own experiences. Consider using examples from your personal life and discuss how they relate to the topic under discussion. </li>

				<li class="li_text">Review grammar, punctuation, and spelling and proofread your posts before submitting them. </li>
				</ul>


				<p class="txt">Like your written papers, your discussion posts are likely to be graded on their content, completeness, and quality. Your posts do not have to include a title page, but they do need to be written in complete sentences. Unless otherwise instructed, you must reference all outside sources you use in your posts. Discussing only your personal opinion and failing to support it with evidence from the text will likely result in a poor grade, unless your instructor specifically says no citation is necessary. You must include references for all ideas that are not your own. Because discussion posts mimic the types of discussions held in a face-to-face classroom, they are typically written in an informal conversational tone. However, the language must be appropriate for formal college writing. In other words, avoid slang, abbreviations, and the informal language common to personal emails or text messages. Posts should clearly respond to questions your instructor has asked, directly engage with the text, and/or contribute something meaningful to the class discussion. Brief responses such as &ldquo;I disagree&rdquo; or &ldquo;I completely agree&rdquo; are not sufficient. </p>


				<p class="txt">A thoughtful discussion post should explore ideas and may reflect a change in one&rsquo;s opinion. Discussion posts are typically evaluated according to a rubric. The grade you receive on your post will likely be based on the criteria identified in the rubric. However, even if your post meets certain rubric requirements, like using correct grammar, if it does not reply to the instructor&rsquo;s question, it will not be considered sufficient. This is why it is critically important to understand what an assignment is asking of you. Ask for clarification if you need it. Note that if your instructor asks you to reply directly to other posts, this will likely be a part of the grading rubric for that assignment as well. After all, responding to and engaging with your peers is typically the &ldquo;discussion&rdquo; part of a discussion post! </p>




				<h3 class="h3">Assignments </h3>

				<p class="txt">Remember that to earn the highest possible grade on a discussion assignment, you must cover all of the key areas. </p>

<a id="p135"></a>

				<p class="txt">The example in <em>Try It: Identifying Key Words, Phrases, and Action Verbs</em> asks you to find the action verbs and corresponding objectives and requirements in Table 8.3 and determine the assignment&rsquo;s requirements. </p>

				<p class="txt">Note that the assignment in the <em>Try It</em> feature asks the student to write about a special occasion or event. This may seem minor, but it is not. If a well-intentioned student writes a summary of several special events, it would not constitute an adequate response to the assignment. The assignment asks the writer to focus on one specific event, in part because doing so teaches writers how to focus on one moment and to amplify the scene with details. If the student writes about two or three events instead of just one, the events will likely end up summarized, and there will be far fewer details in the writing. Make sure to always answer each part of an assignment. Reread the assignment several times, marking it carefully, to make sure you understand all of the tasks it is asking you to complete. </p>

	  <h2 class="h2">Conclusion</h2>

		<p class="txt">Reading is so complex and important that it impacts almost every aspect of our lives. If it were simple, it wouldn&rsquo;t carry with it so much value, so know that all the effort you put into your college-level reading assignments will pay off. The amount and difficulty of required reading in college is a universal challenge for new college students. Specific reading strategies tailored to how you learn and what material you are reading will help you manage all your reading tasks. Organization plays a significant role in the various ways you can approach reading tasks. In all reading strategies, you are working to understand the key elements of the passage so you can recall and use that information later when you review. Active reading constitutes a considerable time commitment for college students, so planning ahead is crucial. </p>
