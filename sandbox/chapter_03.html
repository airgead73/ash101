	 <p class="txt">And technology has carved huge inroads into our educational systems. There are now Internet sites that allow students to upload and sell their class notes; social media sites where learners and teachers can interact and share ideas and material; smartphone apps that organize study material; devices that allow students to write or draw on tablet or computer screens with a finger, stick, or pen; texting programs that simplify class participation; lesson-planning apps and software; report card templates; resource sites for a vast range of subjects; lesson and report presentation software for teachers and learners; and so on.</p>

 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">And will the digitization of schools influence&#8212;and help&#8212;in the selection and clarification of the goals that underlie the designs of our curricula? Will it help us with the alignment of curriculum, assessment, and instruction?</p>
 <p class="txt">What will students learn in tomorrow&#39;s schools?</p>

	<div class="inner-section">
	 <h2 class="h2">What Is Learning?</h2>
	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="key-point">One thing is certain about tomorrow&#39;s schools: There will be easy access to vastly more information than there was in yesterday&#39;s schools . . . or even in today&#39;s. Yet learning isn&#39;t simply the acquisition of information&#8212;although that can be part of it.</p>
	 <p class="txt">For example, if you google the word <em>peanut</em>, you will find out that this legume does not grow on trees but rather underground like potatoes. You have acquired information about peanuts.</p>
	 <p class="txt">However, what is acquired during learning is not always as obvious.</p>
 
	 <p class="txt">Say, for example, that Ava volunteers to read her short story about centipedes to her fourth-grade classmates. And suppose that Mrs. Hutchins, the teacher, laughs sarcastically at how she pronounces <em>centipede</em> and criticizes her story line. &quot;Your story is not very interesting,&quot; she sneers. &quot;If you can&#39;t write anything better, don&#39;t bother reading it to the class.&quot;</p>

	 <a id="p93"></a>
	 <p class="txt">As a result of Ava&#39;s experience, most of the other students become far more hesitant to read their stories out loud. There has apparently been a change in their <strong>disposition</strong>, or their inclination to do (or not to do) something. Changes in disposition are closely related to what psychologists label <strong>motivation</strong>&#8212;the forces that underlie behavior. Learning involves not only changes in disposition but also changes in <strong>capability</strong>, which often entail the acquisition of new skills and knowledge.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Much like changes in disposition, changes in capability are not always immediately apparent. </p>
	 <p class="txt">For example, hearing Mrs. Hutchins correct Ava&#39;s pronunciation may have led Diego to realize that he, too, has always mispronounced <em>centipede</em>. He might never make that mistake again. But the conclusion that Diego and perhaps Ava have now learned to pronounce centipede correctly can be based only on their <strong>performance</strong>&#8212;their actual behavior. Not until they actually pronounce the word can the inference be made that they have learned to do so correctly.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Psychologists usually look for evidence of learning in the changes that occur in people&#39;s performance.</p>
	 <p class="key-point">However, not all changes in behavior are evidence of learning.</p>
	 <p class="txt">If, for example, someone hits you on the side of the head or feeds you strange mushrooms, your behavior might change in dramatic ways, but to conclude that these changes in behavior are evidence of learning is to stretch the meaning of the term beyond reason. Similarly, changes in behavior that result from fatigue, physical maturation, or illness are not evidence of learning.</p>
	 <p class="key-point">Accordingly, <span class="txt_bold">learning</span> may be defined as</p>
	 
	 <p class="ext"><em>A relatively permanent change in potential for behavior as a result of experience, providing </em><em>that the change is not simply the often temporary effects of factors such as drugs, fatigue, </em><em>illness, or maturation.</em></p>
	 
	 <p class="txt">This definition specifies that learning involves changes in <em>potential</em> for behavior. That&#39;s because, as we saw, the relatively permanent effects of learning are not always apparent. Many changes in disposition or in capability may remain latent (hidden) unless circumstances give rise to the behavior in question (see Figure 3.1). If Diego and Ava are never again placed in a situation in which they need to say <em>centipede</em>, no one may ever know that they have learned to do so correctly.</p>

	 <h2 class="h2">Relating Learning and Assessment: Backward Design</h2>
	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">Recall from Chapter 1 that the backward design approach to building a curriculum&#8212;or planning a course or even a single lesson&#8212;begins with a clear statement of goals. The instructor can then decide which assessments can be used to determine whether students have reached these learning objectives; and finally, the instructor can plan approaches that are most likely to maximize the likelihood that learners will reach the goals.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Accordingly, if teaching fourth graders to say <em>centipede</em> correctly is one of the learning objectives of a course, then devising an assessment method that requires them to demonstrate their ability to do so becomes an important task for the teacher. In the same way, if being able to solve arithmetic problems of the kind &quot;16 &divide; 4 =&quot; is a learning objective, the most useful assessments will give learners the opportunity to demonstrate&#8212;and develop&#8212;their skill in solving such problems.</p>
		 <p class="txt">To summarize and simplify, the backward design approach involves three steps.</p>
	 <ol class="nl">
		 <li class="li_text">Identify goals.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">Select assessments.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">Plan approaches to reach these goals.</li>
		 </ol>
	 <p class="txt">This approach, implicit in the backward design of this third chapter, can be illustrated in the following example of logical reasoning.</p>
	 <p class="txt">The most useful educational assessments are formative: They are designed to foster learning. If the overarching purpose of our educational systems were reduced to a single statement, it might read something like this:</p>

	 <a id="p95"></a>
	 <p class="ext"><em>The goal of education is to promote learning.</em></p>

	 <p class="txt">And if the purpose of educational assessment were reduced to a single statement, it might be worded as follows:</p>

	<p class="ext"><em>The purpose of educational assessment is to determine the extent to which educational goals </em><em>are being met and to guide and support the teacher&#39;s and the learner&#39;s efforts toward those </em><em>goals.</em></p>

	 <p class="txt">The relationship between learning and assessment is clear in these statements. The logic can be summarized this way: </p>

	<p class="ext"><em>Student learning is a central instructional goal; the purpose of educational assessment is </em><em>to foster the attainment of instructional goals and to measure the extent to which they are </em><em>being met; therefore, educational assessment must promote and measure student learning.</em></p>

	<p class="key-point">It follows from this process of logical reasoning (known as a <span class="txt_bold">syllogism</span>) that those who would master the arts of educational assessment must first know about human learning.</p>

Then along came Ivan Pavlov (1849&#8211;1936), who will always be remembered for a series of extraordinarily well-known experiments with dogs.</p>
	 <p class="txt">In these experiments, Pavlov or one of his assistants would <em>condition</em> a dog to salivate in response to a bell or a buzzer. This type of learning is known as <strong>classical conditioning</strong>. The procedure is illustrated in Figure 3.2.</p>

			 <h2 class="h2">Basic Overview of Classical Conditioning</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">		 
		 <p class="txt">Classical conditioning is sometimes referred to as signal learning because, in a sense, the <strong>conditioned stimulus</strong> serves as a signal for the <strong>conditioned response</strong>. For example, in the case of Pavlov&#39;s dogs, the buzzer is a signal that food is about to follow.</p> 

		 <p class="txt">Classical conditioning depends on the presence of an automatic, unlearned response such as salivation (termed a <strong>reflex</strong>) or on the presence of a previously learned response. Because we humans are born with a limited number of reflexes, explained psychologist John Broadus Watson (1878&#8211;1958), classical conditioning applies to us as much as it does to dogs.</p>
		<p class="txt">In fact, Watson&#8212;who was greatly influenced by Pavlov&#8212;believed that all learning is a matter of the classical conditioning of reflexes. His <em>science of behavior</em> quickly became immensely popular in the United States. He called it <strong>behaviorism</strong> because it dealt with actual behavior rather than with abstract concepts like mind and consciousness (Watson, 1913).</p>
		<p class="txt">In its most extreme interpretations, Watson&#39;s behaviorism is a form of <em>environmentalism</em>, reflecting the belief that all learning results from the conditioning of responses as a result of the pairing of environmental events.</p>
		<p class="txt">While this form of extreme environmentalism has largely been rejected, there is nevertheless an element of truth&#8212;and of usefulness&#8212;in the basic idea of classical conditioning. We know, for example, that many emotional responses are learned through classical conditioning. People who fear big dogs do not do so because they study them and decide, rationally and sensibly, that the animals are worthy of fear. Those individuals likely feel afraid as a result of exposure to fearsome dogs&#8212;either in real life or in the books, movies, television programs, and video games they are exposed to.</p>

	 <h2 class="h2">Classical Conditioning in the Classroom</h2>
	 <div class="single-column">
 
	 <p class="txt">As Figure 3.3 illustrates, classical conditioning also occurs in schools. In this figure, an entire subject, health sciences, becomes an <strong>unconditioned stimulus</strong> for negative emotional reactions, leading to several important instructional implications.</p>
 
	 <ul class="bl">
	<li class="li_text">Teachers should try to maximize the number, distinctiveness, and potency of stimuli associated with positive reactions. For example, large, bright, smiley faces sometimes used as comments on first graders&#39; efforts, coupled with other stimuli such as teachers&#39; smiles, their verbal approval, and their gestures, can be distinctive, potent sources of positive reinforcement.
	</li>
	<li class="li_text">Teachers should try to minimize the occurrence and strength of stimuli associated with negative reactions. Derogatory comments such as those exemplified by Mrs. Hutchins when Ava attempted to say <em>centipede</em> followed by her comment, &quot;Your story is not very interesting,&quot; illustrate how these negative responses to student behavior can be a source of punishment leading to students&#39; subsequent reluctance to participate.
	</li>
	<li class="li_text">Teachers need to be aware of what is being paired with what in the classroom. Classrooms, subjects, teachers, and lessons characterized by a warm and engaging atmosphere and by the absence of real or implied threats are most likely to lead to positive outcomes. Those marked by more discouraging and unfriendly characteristics may well lead to a variety of negative conditioned emotional reactions.

	 <h2 class="h2">Basic Overview of Operant Conditioning</h2>
	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">There is more to learning than simple classical conditioning, argued Burrhus F. Skinner. Surely, repeatedly pairing two stimuli, as Pavlov did when conditioning his dogs to salivate in response to a bell or buzzer, is not always enough: The consequences of a behavior must also be important. Skinner called his theory of learning <strong>operant conditioning</strong>.</p>

	 <p class="txt">As Edward Thorndike (1911/1965) had insisted, and as most teachers already knew, if a behavior leads to a pleasant state of affairs, it is more likely to be repeated (learned) than if it leads to an unpleasant state of affairs. Thorndike labeled this principle the <strong>law of effect</strong>.</p>
		<p class="txt">Classical or Pavlovian conditioning, explained Skinner, is probably an adequate explanation for some simple forms of learning, in which stimuli clearly lead to responses (he called these responses <strong>respondents</strong>). This kind of learning might be explained by the repeated simultaneous presence of two stimuli such as food and a buzzer. This is referred to as a <strong>contiguity</strong> explanation for learning. Contiguity has to do with the simultaneous or nearly simultaneous occurrence of events. A contiguity explanation for learning says that all is required for a stimulus and a response to become linked is that there be a close <em>temporal relationship</em> between the two (in other words, that they occur at about the same time).</p>
		<p class="txt">Pavlov and Watson were contiguity theorists; they believed that if two events occur simultaneously often enough, they become linked. Skinner accepted that this was the case for <em>respondents</em>&#8212;behaviors clearly brought about by identifiable stimuli.</p>

	 <p class="txt">But most of our behaviors, he explained, are not respondents; they are <strong>operants</strong>&#8212;actions like reading a book, going for a walk, singing, and so on&#8212;that we perform for any of a variety of reasons. These are emitted rather than elicited responses (see Figure 3.4).</p>
	 <p class="txt">Using an ingenious piece of equipment that came to be known as a <strong>Skinner box</strong>, Skinner demonstrated how rats could be trained to depress levers, and pigeons could be trained to peck at disks. He demonstrated, as well, how an animal&#39;s behavior could be <em>shaped</em> so that it would emit complex sequences of behaviors and how varying the timing and amount of reinforcement used could dramatically affect responding.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">Reinforcement and Punishment</h3>
		<p class="txt"><strong>Reinforcement</strong>, defined as the effect of a stimulus that increases the probability that a response will be repeated, is a central concept in Skinner&#39;s theory. <strong>Positive reinforcement</strong> is a consequence that, when added to a situation following a response, increases the probability of that response. For example, in ongoing formative assessment, feedback that tells teachers and learners that they are going in the right direction is a powerful source of positive reinforcement.</p>

		<a id="p101"></a>
		<p class="txt"><strong>Negative reinforcement</strong> also increases the probability of a response, but does so when it is removed from a situation. For example, a negative consequence of classroom misbehavior might be that a child is isolated in the classroom and not allowed to participate in a playtime activity. If, after showing evidence of opposing good behavior, the child is then allowed to rejoin his or her classmates, the hope is that the removal of the isolation will serve as negative reinforcement for good behavior.</p>
		<p class="txt">Negative reinforcement is sometimes confused with <strong>punishment</strong>, although the two are distinctly different. Both are defined in terms of their effects: Reinforcement, whether positive or negative, results in an increase in the probability of a response; punishment is intended to have the opposite effect.</p>
		<p class="txt">The four possibilities that result when positive and negative outcomes are added or removed as a consequence of behavior are illustrated in Figure 3.6. Positive and negative reinforcement, as well as the two kinds of punishment, are shown with classroom examples in Figure 3.7.</p>

		<h3 class="h3">Shaping and Feedback</h3>
		<p class="txt">It is widely accepted and easily illustrated that reinforcement and the lack thereof are powerful forces in <strong>shaping</strong> behavior. Shaping is the process by which behavior is gradually changed by reinforcing successively closer approximations to the final desired behavior. It is a technique widely used in training animals.</p>
		<p class="txt">Human behavior, too, is highly susceptible to the influence of stimuli such as praise, money, high grades, promotions, smiles, and love (Skinner, 1953). And in the same way that presentation of these stimuli following a behavior can serve to increase that behavior, their removal can have the opposite effect.</p>
		<p class="txt">In education, and especially in formative assessments used to enhance motivation and promote learning, the consequences that <em>shape</em> learner behaviors come largely in the form of <strong>feedback</strong>. Basically, feedback is information about the consequences of behaviors and strategies. Feedback often takes the form of information about errors&#8212;errors being &quot;the difference between what we know and can do, and what we aim to know and do&quot; (Hattie, 2012, p. 115). Providing appropriate levels of feedback and challenge are among the most powerful tools in the teacher&#39;s toolbox. Feedback is designed to reduce the gap between where learners are and where they are meant to be. (See <em>In the Classroom: The ARCS Theory of Motivational Design</em>.)</p>

		 </div>

		 <div class="section-lead">
		 <p class="intro">Early explanations of learning such as those provided by Pavlov, Watson, and Skinner dealt mainly with observable behaviors, a fact that led Watson (1913) to coin the term <em>behaviorism</em> for his brand of psychology.</p> 
		 </div>

		<div class="section-body">
		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">And while the classical and operant conditioning principles of behaviorism have proved useful in understanding human behavior, they provide only a few pieces of the puzzle. Most important, Bandura (1997) explains, is our ability to imagine, symbolize, and anticipate&#8212;all of which are cognitive activities.</p>
		 <p class="txt">Perhaps the rat in the Skinner box depresses the lever because of some insurmountable urge based solely on past experience with levers and food pellets that led to the operant conditioning of bar-pressing behavior. But it seems unlikely that most of our daily activities&#8212;our work and play&#8212;result from mindless and insurmountable urges based solely on previously reinforced or punished experiences. We <em>know</em> what the results of our behaviors are likely to be. We <em>anticipate</em> them; we <em>hope</em> for the most desirable outcomes; and we take pains to avoid the negative consequences we <em>imagine</em>. Hoping, anticipating, knowing, thinking, forming concepts, and imagining are activities sometimes referred to as <em>higher mental processes</em>. They are the province of <strong>cognitive psychology</strong>.</p> 
			 
			 <p class="txt">Studying cognitive processes has not been easy. The observable behaviors that concerned the behaviorists of the 20th century can, by definition, be observed. And the effects that stimuli and consequences have on them can be measured. Thoughts and ideas, on the other hand, do not easily lend themselves to observation and measurement.</p>

		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">Cognitive psychology and behaviorism differ in a number of important ways. Whereas behaviorism tries to understand human and animal behavior in terms of external, observable events like stimuli, responses, and the consequences of behavior, cognitive psychology deals with the mental processes that underlie behavior. It tries to understand difficult concepts such as <em>thinking, meaning</em> and, yes, <em>concepts</em>. The main differences between cognitive psychology and behaviorism are summarized in Table 3.1.</p>

		 <p class="txt">Approaches to cognitive psychology are distinguished by three common assumptions and beliefs (Lefran&#231;ois, 2012):</p>
		 
		 <h3 class="h3">1. Current Learning Depends on Previous Learning</h3>
		 <p class="txt">Early behaviorists tended to view all learners as initially identical in terms of capacity to learn, equally subject to being molded by the environment&#8212;as Watson (1930) emphasized when he claimed he could make whatever he wanted of any healthy child selected at random:</p>
		 <p class="ext">Give me a dozen healthy infants well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I&#39;ll guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select&#8212;doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents, penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. (p. 104)</p>
		 <p class="txt">Cognitivists, on the other hand, emphasize that individual learners bring with them different background knowledge, different motivation, and different skills. And what they learn depends very much on what they bring to the learning situation. In fact, as Hattie (2009, 2015a) discovered in his analysis of more than 1,200 relevant studies, what learners bring to the learning situation (their abilities, prior knowledge, and motivation) appears to be the most important influence on school achievement. In higher education, these same factors account for around 50% of the variance in achievement. Qualities of the teacher are second in importance, accounting for around 20% of the learning variance.</p>

		 <h3 class="h3">2. Learning Involves Information Processing </h3>
		 <p class="txt">The learner, as seen by cognitive psychology, is not a passive receiver of information who reacts almost unconsciously to stimulation and to <strong>rewards</strong> and punishments but is actively involved in the learning process. As a result, cognitive theories attempt to understand learning in terms of how we process information. They look at the strategies we learn and invent for abstracting concepts and organizing them in memory.</p>

		 <h3 class="h3">3. Meaning Depends on Relationships </h3>
		 <p class="txt">Consider the following passage.</p>
		 <p class="tx"><em>If it were really high the whole thing might last a long time but I don&#39;t know if </em><em>the wheels would be turning. I know that one of the problems is there is nothing </em><em>to hold on to and no way to stop and it doesn&#39;t matter if it has wheels and brakes. </em><em>If you were thirsty or hungry you couldn&#39;t really stop anywhere. Of course, you </em><em>would have to be prepared beforehand and maybe go to the bathroom too. And </em><em>if it didn&#39;t last very long, it would really not be worth it.</em></p>
		 <p class="txt">For most people, this passage is about as meaningful as Stephen Hawking&#39;s theories. The language is clear and simple, the sentences are brief, and none of the concepts is very difficult; yet the paragraph makes little sense.</p>

		 <p class="caption">Although it might seem a bizarre activity, the meaning of this photograph is clear. But the paragraph that describes it in the text means little without the context provided by the photo.</p>
		 </figcaption>
		 </figure>

		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">But if you look at the photograph and reread the passage, it becomes perfectly clear. That&#39;s because the photo provides a framework of relationships that give it meaning.</p>
		 </div>
</div>
		
			 <h2 class="h2">Concept Formation</h2>
			 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">An important function of schools is to promote concept formation. However, there isn&#39;t yet complete agreement about how concepts are formed. One simple way of defining concepts is in terms of nouns. All nouns are, in effect, labels for simple categories. Dog, cow, horse, and hoary marmot are all categories defined in terms of the attributes we note when we interact with these creatures&#8212;or when we read, talk, or write about them. Verbs, which usually express relationships among nouns, are also a form of category. &quot;Horse kicks hoary marmot&quot; or &quot;Cow growls at dog&quot; bring to mind images based on our direct and indirect experiences with these creatures and on our experiences with kicking and growling.</p>
		 <p class="txt">In most of the world&#39;s languages, children tend to learn nouns before they learn verbs. Hence, they learn concepts associated with nouns before learning concepts linked with actions (Waxman &amp; Lidz, 2006; Waxman et al., 2013). Strangely, however, they don&#39;t begin by learning the most specific concepts and then progressing to the most general. Instead, they learn concepts of intermediate generality. Thus, they learn the concept &quot;cat&quot; before they learn the more specific concepts represented by &quot;Siamese,&quot; &quot;Manx,&quot; or &quot;American shorthair.&quot; Later, they learn more general concepts such as &quot;mammal&quot; or &quot;vertebrate.&quot;</p>

			 <a id="p107"></a>
		 <p class="txt">Concept boundaries are often fuzzy rather than definite. Not all events or objects that represent the same concept are exactly equivalent. For example, a wide range of input will be accepted as belonging to the concept &quot;red.&quot; But some hues of red are brilliant and some are, well, less red. Similarly, our criteria for concepts such as &quot;attractive&quot; and &quot;unattractive,&quot; &quot;fat&quot; and &quot;skinny,&quot; &quot;tall&quot; and &quot;short,&quot; and so on, tend to have unclear and highly individualistic boundaries that are difficult to verbalize.</p>
		 <p class="txt">There are two competing explanations for how we abstract the attributes of objects, events, and ideas to form concepts. One, the <strong>prototype model</strong>, claims that we develop highly generalized notions of the most representative features of related objects as a result of experiencing a number of such objects. Thus, after seeing hundreds of trees, Jaylen has developed an abstract, generalized model (a prototype) of a tree (Rosch, 1977). But this idealized abstraction might, in fact, bear little resemblance to any specific tree Jaylen has ever seen.</p>
		 <p class="txt">A second model, the <strong>exemplar model</strong>, suggests that Jaylen&#39;s &quot;tree&quot; concept is not an abstraction but is her memory of actual trees she has seen that now serve as examples she can compare with other objects that might also be trees (Johansen, Fouquet, Savage, &amp; Shanks, 2013; Murphy, 2016).</p>
		 <p class="txt">Although researchers do not agree about which of these two models is best, there is evidence that both might be involved in concept learning (Ashby &amp; Rosedahl, 2017; Vanpaemel &amp; Storms, 2008).</p>
		 <p class="txt">There is evidence, too, that the best teachers are those who pay the greatest attention to the development of abstract concepts among their learners. As Hattie (2012) explains, these are teachers whose instructional goals go well beyond simple learning and regurgitation of facts and procedures. As he puts it: </p>
		 <p class="tx"><em>Expert teachers do differ from experienced teachers&#8212;particularly on the way </em><em>they represent their classrooms, the degree of challenges that they present </em><em>to students, and most critically, in the depth of processing that their students </em><em>attain. Students who are taught by expert teachers exhibit an understanding </em><em>of the concepts targeted in instruction that is more integrated, more coherent, </em><em>and at a higher level of abstraction than the understanding achieved by other </em><em>students</em>. (Hattie, 2003, p. 15)</p>

		 <p class="intro">An important goal of educational systems is to develop learners who are skilled at building and manipulating concepts. Accordingly, our assessment procedures need to be devised in such a way that they promote the development of <strong>cognitive strategies</strong> and reflect the extent to which we are successful in developing them in our learners. </p>

		<div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt"><em>Cognitive strategy</em> is a general term for the plans and actions that we use to control, monitor, and improve our cognitive (mental) functioning. They include all the processes by which knowledge and information become part of our <strong>knowledge base</strong>&#8212;the storehouse of information and ideas that we build up through life. </p>
		 <p class="key-point">These strategies are the methods we use in forming concepts, learning, and remembering. </p>
		 <p class="txt">They include ways of identifying problems and procedures for solving them. They allow us to monitor our progress when we undertake intellectual tasks, and they suggest changes we might make to improve our likelihood of success. Cognitive strategies develop gradually in childhood as we learn <em>how</em> to learn and becoming progressively more independent, highly motivated, and competent learners.</p>
		 <p class="txt">As we will see in Chapter 5, a number of recent approaches to classroom assessment are based on what we know of the learner&#39;s cognitive skills and strategies. This knowledge allows researchers to develop models of what are termed learning progressions. </p>
		 <p class="txt">A <strong>learning progression</strong> is a sequential description of the learner&#39;s progress toward attaining a concept or a skill. Learning, by definition, involves progression or development. It is important for teachers to understand the sequences and pathways through which learners are expected to progress. Understanding and analyzing students&#39; learning progressions serves as a basis for both instruction and assessment. Furthermore, as we will see in Chapter 5, analysis of learning progressions can also help instructors diagnose and perhaps remediate learning problems (DiCerbo, Xu, Levy, Lai, &amp; Holland, 2017). Hence, knowing and assessing student learning progressions can be an important part of assessment for learning (formative assessment). (See <em>In the Classroom: Building Scaffolds</em>.)</p>

		 <h3 class="h3">In the Classroom: Building Scaffolds</h3>
		 <p class="txt">Say you wanted to build a four-story doghouse (seems strange that you would need four stories, but it&#39;s your doghouse). So you begin by laying some sort of foundation for the house. Next you knock together something of a frame and begin to construct it. But wait&#8212;this is a four-story structure. You can&#39;t just reach up from the ground when you need to screw and bolt and nail beyond the first story. You need a scaffold that you can climb up and stand on while you build. Later, when you have the floors and the roof done, you will no longer need the scaffold.</p>

		 <p class="txt">Good instruction, explains the Russian psychologist Lev Vygotsky (1992), is a little like building a house: It requires <strong>scaffolding</strong>. You have to make sure there is a solid foundation based on prerequisite skills and knowledge, maturity level, and learner interest (motivation). Then you have to support the learner, especially in the early stages. A first grader newly introduced to arithmetic can hardly be expected to discover all the magical properties of written and spoken numerals. But by demonstrating, pointing, correcting, showing, and asking, the teacher constructs scaffolds for the learner. And as the learner progresses and builds up a store of information and a range of strategies for dealing with that information, the need for scaffolding lessens and changes.</p>

		 <p class="txt">Vygotsky&#39;s concept of scaffolding is closely tied to his notion of the <strong>zone of proximal development</strong>&#8212;a phrase that refers to the learner&#39;s potential for development. Simply put, the zone of proximal development describes the tasks and achievements a learner is capable of with the help of adults or peers. In other words, it describes learning possibilities that require support&#8212;that require scaffolding. The important point, Vygotsky explains, is that the scaffolding (the support) must be for tasks that lie within the zone of proximal development. If tasks are beyond that zone, they will be too difficult and too frustrating. But tasks that present no challenge&#8212;that have already been mastered&#8212;are also outside the zone of proximal development. They require no scaffolding, but they lead to no new learning.</p>

		 <p class="txt">As students gradually learn how to learn, they become more autonomous and more self-regulated. They can now set their own goals, direct and monitor their activities in search of these goals, and evaluate and modify their learning strategies as required. If schools are truly successful in teaching students how to learn, learners will eventually search for or build their own scaffolds as they need them. And in the end, the teacher&#39;s role might be very different.</p>

		 <p class="txt">But in the beginning, there are many different ways that teachers and parents can help build scaffolds&#8212;or support&#8212;for children, including the following:</p>

		 <ul class="bl">
		 <li class="li_text">demonstrating how to do things</li>
		 <li class="li_text">explaining procedures</li>
		 <li class="li_text">providing written or actual models</li>
		 <li class="li_text">systematically developing all the prerequisite skills required for more demanding tasks</li>
		 <li class="li_text">asking questions that lead to certain important realizations</li>
		 <li class="li_text">correcting on-task errors</li>
		 <li class="li_text">identifying and correcting misconceptions</li>

		 <h2 class="h2">Metacognition</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">Understanding the sequences children progress through as they learn (i.e., understanding their learning progressions) is basic to good instruction and assessment. For example, it is useful to know that young children are not especially good at organizing material to discover its meaning or remember it, nor are they aware of the importance of doing so. Put another way, they still know little about knowing. They have not yet developed the skills of metacognition. Instructional strategies and assessment procedures based on the expectation that they have mastered these skills are likely to be ineffective and frustrating.</p>
		 <p class="txt">The prefix <em>meta-</em>, of Greek origin, is used to describe something that refers to itself. In essence, it means &quot;beyond&quot; or &quot;behind.&quot; </p>
		 <p class="key-point">Hence, the term <em>metacognition</em> refers to what individuals know about their own cognitive process. The skills of metacognition are what allow us to monitor our progress when we try to learn, understand, and memorize. </p>
		 <p class="txt">Metacognitive skills permit us to estimate the likelihood that we will succeed, and we use them to determine when and how we should change our strategies, invent new ones, or turn to easier tasks. </p>
		 <p class="key-point">Metacognition is what informs us that there are ways of approaching intellectual tasks&#8212;ways of organizing, simplifying, rehearsing, and reviewing&#8212;that are better than others.</p>
		 <p class="txt">Cognitive strategies are centrally involved in a large number of school-based activities, as well as in daily life. For example, if we are frightened&#8212;or afraid of being frightened&#8212;most of us can use strategies such as deliberate imagery, reappraisal, rational examination, and so on to control our emotions (Igna &amp; Stefan, 2015). Similarly, the performance of children who experience math difficulties can be significantly improved by instructing them in the use of relevant strategies (Swanson, Lussier, &amp; Orosco, 2015). In fact, there is evidence that even physical strength can be improved with the use of cognitive strategies such as goal setting, imagery, self-arousal, and self-talk (Tod, Edwards, McGuigan, &amp; Lovell, 2015).</p>

		 <h2 class="h2">Developing Cognitive Strategies</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">
			 <p class="txt">In the preschool period, children do not have a large repertoire of cognitive strategies. For example, they tend not to use memory strategies such as organizing or rehearsing. And trying to teach them to do so does not necessarily improve their recall. </p>
		 <p class="key-point">But by age 6 or so, children can easily be encouraged to use effective strategies, although they are unlikely to use them spontaneously.</p>
		 <p class="txt">In a study of the development of cognitive memory strategies in children, Schneider, Kron-Sperl, and H&uuml;nnerkopf (2009) followed a group of 102 kindergarten children, testing them at intervals between ages 6 years, 5 months and 10 years, 4 months. The tests were designed to uncover the extent to which children used sorting strategies when given a simple memory task (they were asked to remember as many words as they could from a list of 20 items that could easily be sorted into five categories). The results, shown in Figure 3.9, reveal a steady progression in the use of sorting strategies and a corresponding improvement in the number of items recalled.</p>

		 <p class="intro">As we learn how to learn, explains Flavell (1985), we begin to see ourselves as players of what he calls the game of cognition.

		 <p class="txt">Some people play the game of cognition very badly: They learn with difficulty and recall unpredictably and uncertainly. Others play the game with surprising ease: They learn rapidly and easily and recall with stunning accuracy. Those who play this game well may have a larger and better repertoire of cognitive strategies at their disposal. And perhaps they use them more effectively. This is not to say that cognitive strategies are the only determiner of how well someone plays the game of cognition. Individual differences in motivation, personality, intelligence, opportunity, and reinforcement might also have some profound influences.</p>
		 <p class="txt">Remembering&#8212;and performance that demonstrates remembering&#8212;is the hallmark of learning. Assessment of school achievement almost invariably taps what it is that learners remember and what new capabilities they might have developed. Even measures of intelligence are sensitive to how individuals have benefited from experience&#8212;hence, they are sensitive to the effects of <strong>memory</strong>. </p>
		 <p class="txt">One of the most widely accepted models of memory is that first proposed by Atkinson and Shiffrin (1968). It describes memory in terms of three components: <strong>sensory memory</strong>, <strong>short-term memory</strong>, and <strong>long-term memory</strong> (see Figure 3.10). Since its introduction, the model has given rise to considerable research and discussion and has been modified and expanded in various ways.</p>

Most of the sights, sounds, smells, and other stimulation that surround us never become part of our longer term memory. But research indicates that this stimulation nevertheless has a momentary effect and that if there were some reason to pay attention to it, it would become conscious and might later be recalled. </p>
		 <p class="txt">For example, when you find yourself having a one-on-one conversation in a crowded room, you may seem to be completely unaware of all other conversations going on in the room. But if someone across the room mentions your name, the chances are good that your attention will now immediately turn to that conversation. Because this phenomenon is often observed in social gatherings, it has been labeled the <strong>cocktail-party phenomenon</strong> (Cherry, 1953). This phenomenon is present very early in life, as Newman (2005) found when she looked at infants&#39; reactions to hearing their name in a context of other unrelated noise. In Newman&#39;s investigation, 1-year-old infants readily responded to their names even at very low decibels. Even infants only 5 months old detected their names, but only when these were spoken at somewhat higher volumes.</p>

		 <h2 class="h2">Short-Term Memory</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">
			 <p class="txt">What was originally called short-term memory in the Atkinson&#8211;Shiffrin model is now most often referred to as <strong>working memory</strong> (Baddeley, 2007). Working memory is what happens when you pay attention to stimulus input, such as your name spoken in a crowded room. It is defined in terms of immediate awareness&#8212;what you are conscious of at this moment. </p>
		 <p class="txt">The label <em>working memory</em> indicates that the information in immediate consciousness is now available for processing. During this brief memory stage, information is kept in mind long enough to solve problems (such as 2 + 2), make decisions, key in telephone numbers, and perform related activities involving conscious awareness. </p>

		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">Unlike the phrase <em>short-term memory</em>, the expression working memory refers to the functions of this memory stage as opposed to its duration. The Baddeley model of working memory speculates that there must be a sort of <strong>central executive system</strong> to supervise and control the workings of short term memory. Its three most important functions are (a) to control the flow of information from sensory storage into conscious awareness, (b) to process information for longer term storage, and (c) to retrieve information from long-term storage and bring it once more into conscious awareness. </p>
		 <p class="txt">The Baddeley model also suggests that there must be at least two different systems to maintain verbal and visual information in immediate awareness. These are called <strong>slave systems</strong> because, in a sense, they do the bidding of the central executive system. The slave systems include the <em>phonological loop</em>, which maintains verbal material like words and numbers, and the <em>visual&#8211;spatial sketch pad</em>, which keeps material that is primarily visual in conscious awareness. See Figure 3.11 for a brief overview of the these concepts. </p>
		 <p class="txt">An important characteristic of working memory is that it is highly limited in capacity. Following a series of short-term memory studies in which participants were asked to recall words or numbers that had just been presented, Miller (1956) found that normal adults can usually remember about seven items (plus or minus two). Younger children remember fewer.</p>

The slave systems maintain information so that it is available for processing.</p>

		 </div>
		 <div class="section-lead">
		 <p class="intro">Short-term memory (immediate, conscious awareness) depends mainly on rehearsal and repetition and typically lasts only a few seconds. But if material is processed, say in terms of its meaning, it may pass from short-term into long-term memory.</p>
			 

		 </div>


		<div class="section-body">
		 <div class="single-column">
				 <p class="txt">One of the principal general goals of our educational systems is to bring about significant changes in long-term memory.</p>
		 <p class="txt">Long-term memory may be defined in terms of everything that we remember that is not just now occurring. It includes all that we retain of our educational experiences, a complete working knowledge of the languages we know, all our stable information about the world, and a recording of all the personal experiences that we can bring to mind.</p>
		 <p class="txt">Long-term memory tends to be passive: It exists in a relatively permanent form, quite apart from our immediate awareness of it. Therefore, it is not easily disrupted by ongoing events. In contrast, short-term memory is a highly active process defined by the act of paying attention and keeping material in immediate consciousness. As a result, it is easily disrupted by ongoing activities. If the dog growls at you while you&#39;re in the middle of keyboarding a tweet, you may well forget what you were about to keyboard and have to reinvent it later. But if the dog growls&#8212;or even dares to attack you&#8212;while you&#39;re keyboarding a line from a poem you have dredged up from your long-term memory, you can easily, once you take care of the dog, retrieve the line once more.</p>

		 <h2 class="h2">Characteristics of Long-Term Memory</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">Long-term memory is marked by a number of important characteristics.</p>

		 <h3 class="h3">Long-Term Memory Is Highly Stable</h3>
		 <p class="txt">If you remember Mao Tse-tung today, you are also likely to remember him tomorrow&#8212;and next year (you hope). Even memories that cannot easily be put into words may nevertheless be remarkably resistant to the passage of time. For example, every time Daniel catches a whiff of homemade beans baking, he is transported back to his grandmother&#39;s kitchen. The smell of her beans made a lasting impression, but he would be hard-pressed to describe that smell in any meaningful way so that others, too, might sense it. Odors are like that: memorable but nonverbalizable. </p>

			 <h3 class="h3">Understanding Influences Long-Term Memory</h3>
		 <p class="txt">What we remember is influenced by our understanding of the material. For example, when you recall a story that you have heard, what you typically remember is the gist of the story&#8212;its meaning and its most important details. And when you retell the story, you don&#39;t repeat all the words, gestures, pauses, and emphases of the original storyteller. Instead, you generate your own narrative based on your understanding of the story.</p>
		 <p class="txt">The fact that understanding (comprehension) influences long-term memory has important implications for education. These are reflected in current approaches to teaching that define <strong>constructivism</strong>. <em>Constructivism</em> is a general term for the view that the teacher&#39;s role should be one of collaborating with the learner to help in the discovery and <em>construction</em> of long-term memories. Constructivism is often contrasted with <strong>direct teaching</strong>&#8212;an approach that sees the teacher as the primary source of information. In this view, the teacher bears most of the responsibility for directing the learner and for organizing and imparting information.</p>
		 <p class="txt">Constructivism is a student- rather than teacher-centered approach to teaching and learning. Constructivist approaches are based on the notion that learners are at the center of the learning process&#8212;that they are primarily responsible for discovering, organizing, and in effect, constructing their own knowledge. Constructing knowledge requires the development and use of cognitive strategies. Constructivism implies a level of understanding not often evident in approaches to teaching that stress learning and remembering facts (Lefran&ccedil;ois, 2018). </p>

		 <h3 class="h3">Long-Term Memory Is Generative</h3>
		 <p class="txt">The retelling of a story requires you to supply the words and gestures that give it meaning; the ability to do so is evidence of the generative nature of long-term memory. Additional evidence is found in research that has looked at how our previously learned ideas and preconceptions can sometimes lead to memory distortions. For example, Johnson, Bransford, and Solomon (1973) showed participants this passage:</p>
		 <p class="ext"><em>John was trying to fix the birdhouse. He was pounding the nail when his father </em><em>came out to watch him and to help him do the work.</em> (p. 203)</p>

			 <a id="p117"></a>
		 <p class="txt">Later, the participants were shown these two sentences along with a number of others, one of which was this:</p>
		 <p class="ext"><em>John was using the hammer to fix the birdhouse when his father came out to </em><em>watch and to help him do the work.</em> (Johnson et al., 1973, p. 203)</p>
		 <p class="txt">When asked which of the sentences they had seen earlier, most participants were more convinced they had seen the last sentence rather than the two they had actually seen. The reason for this, explain Johnson et al. (2003), is that although the word <em>hammer</em> was not included in the first sentences, participants knew that hammers are used to pound nails. Based on this knowledge, they generated the word into their recollections and immediately recognized the new sentence as being familiar.</p>

		 <h3 class="h3">Some Things Are Remembered More Easily Than Others</h3>
		 <p class="txt">Memory for odors is especially persistent, as is recollection of past personal experiences (termed <em>autobiographical memory</em>). When de Bruijn and Bender (2018) exposed 170 participants to odors and images linked with childhood experiences, odors triggered autobiographical memories far more easily than visual stimulation. </p>
		 <p class="txt">Public events that are highly meaningful, negative, and singularly striking also tend to be highly memorable, often giving rise to what are called <strong>flashbulb memories</strong>. These are extremely vivid recollections that are often shared by a large number of people&#8212;as was the case with the death of John F. Kennedy or the events of September 11, 2001. Flashbulb memories are typically accompanied by what seem to be extraordinarily clear recollections of our personal circumstances (where we were, what we were doing, and what we felt) at the time we learned of the event. However, much of the research in this area suggests that these memories are not especially accurate and that they, like most other long-term memories, tend to become distorted and less accurate over time (Hirst &amp; Phelps, 2016).</p>
		 </div>
			</div>

		 <h2 class="h2">Declarative and Nondeclarative Knowledge</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">Some memories cannot easily be put into words. Memory for odors is one example. How to ride a bicycle is another. These unconscious, nonverbalizable types of memory make up what is labeled <strong>nondeclarative knowledge</strong> (or <em>nondeclarative memory</em>). Put simply, nondeclarative memories are those that cannot be declared. Nondeclarative memories include things such as motor skills or classically conditioned responses such as emotional reactions to stimulation. These memories are sometimes labeled <em>implicit</em> memories. Implicit memory is particularly evident in the performance of a concert pianist who can sit and play a 20-minute piece without once referring to a printed score&#8212;a task made even more complicated by the use of foot pedals and by the extraordinarily rapid and precisely coordinated movements required.</p>
		 <p class="txt">In contrast to our implicit, <em>nondeclarative</em> memories, we have a host of memories that represent <strong>declarative knowledge</strong> (sometimes called explicit or <em>declarative memory</em>). These can be declared; that is, they can be put into words. Declarative memories include most of the information you can recall from your schooling, as well as all the personal (autobiographical) experiences you have had and can now recall and verbalize.</p>

			 <a id="p118"></a>
		 <p class="txt">There are two very distinct kinds of declarative knowledge. One, <strong>semantic knowledge</strong> (or semantic memory), consists of all the stable, abstract knowledge that underlies things like scientific facts, strategies, and language. The other, <strong>episodic knowledge</strong> (or episodic memory), consists of your memory of personal events. Episodic memory is your autobiographical knowledge&#8212;your memory of the things you have done. These memories are typically tied to a time and place and are often linked to emotions as well (see Figure 3.12).</p>

		 <h2 class="h2">Characteristics of Today&#39;s Learners</h2>

		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="key-point">Still, there are some important differences between today&#39;s learner and learners of other generations. </p>
		 <p class="txt">While the rat&#39;s culture has remained reassuringly stable, ours has not. Radical social and technological changes have taken place in our human cultures over the past several generations. Some of these changes have resulted in learners who, in some ways, are very different from the learners of our grandparents&#39; generation.</p>
		 <p class="key-point">For one thing, explains Hart (2008), there are important attitudinal differences among successive generations in the industrialized Western world. </p>
		 <p class="txt">For example, the oldest generation, born before 1945, experienced economic hardships that led to the development of highly disciplined, hardworking people marked by a high degree of respect for order and authority. The subsequent generation, born between 1946 and 1964, are the baby boomers. This generation grew up in far better economic circumstances resulting from hard work and adherence to well-defined career paths. Many of today&#39;s children have grown up in single-parent homes or in homes where both parents worked. They tend to be highly independent and adaptable. As Hart (2008) puts it, they &quot;work to live, not live to work&quot; (p. 2).</p>
		 <p class="txt">Today&#39;s students have been born in very different social and economic circumstances. Many have parents who pay a great deal more attention to them and indulge them more than was the case for older generations. They tend to be very confident, self-reliant, and highly social. And for most of them, computers, the Internet, and social media are an enormous influence. Whereas in 1995 only 8% of all schools had Internet access, over the next 5 years, that figure grew to 94% (National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). Now virtually all schools have Internet access, and 95% of all American children have access to a computer or a smartphone (National Center for Education Statistics, 2016b). As Figure 3.13 shows, U.S. children make extensive use of computers for schoolwork. Digital technology has spread into American schools at an astonishing pace.</p>

		 		 <h2 class="h2">Technology and Today&#39;s Learner</h2>
		 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="key-point">As a result of this technology, both students and the world have changed. Now, claims Prensky (2016), the goals of education must also change. </p>
		 <p class="txt">These goals, he insists, should no longer be directed solely toward improving each individual student; they should be directed toward improving students in order to improve the world. In order to accomplish this task, those who devise electronic learning experiences and who teach students in other ways need to understand how students process and navigate the world. Here are some important characteristics of learners in the <em>net</em> generation (Prensky, 2016; Morreale &amp; Staley, 2016; Hitt, 2013).</p>

		 <ul class="bl">
		 <li class="li_text">They are used to receiving information extraordinarily rapidly.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are more easily distracted; their attention spans are shorter. They are accustomed to quickly switching attention among rapidly changing visual, auditory, and tactile input.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are accustomed to high-impact, colorful, multimodal input.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are more visual than text-based learners.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are highly skilled multitaskers. For example, many prefer to learn while listening to music or watching television.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They think that learning should be fun.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are highly active, always on the go, and far more likely to benefit from e-learning experiences accessible with their phones and tablets rather than solely on computer screens.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are impatient and have little tolerance for long oral lessons.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They are more accustomed to learning by discovering rather than by being told.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They react poorly to simply being given information and then tested for recall.</li>
		 <li class="li_text">They expect learning to be highly relevant.</li>

			 <p class="txt">It should be noted, however, that these descriptions are not characteristic of all of today&#39;s learners. Nor is it certain that the effects of technology are entirely positive.

		 <p class="key-point">Particularly endangered are what they term <em>deep-thinking skills</em>. </p>
		 <p class="txt">There is evidence that some of these skills might be lost at least partly because of changes in the developing brain such as those related to reduced attention spans and higher susceptibility to distraction. To compensate for these lost skills, they argue, teachers should commit themselves even more to the development of important analytical and critical-thinking skills in learners. </p>
		 <p class="key-point">The most effective of today&#39;s teachers are those who have learned to communicate and teach in ways that are compatible with the characteristics of these learners. </p>
		 <p class="txt">Increasingly, today&#39;s teachers need to be skilled in the use of <strong>educational technology</strong>, both for learning and assessment. Prensky (2016) argues that the wise use of technology can enhance learning and the effective use of our brains in ways never before experienced.</p>

	 </div>

	<div class="section-body">
	 <div class="single-column">
		 <p class="txt">These technological resources include computer hardware and software, computer-based approaches to instruction and assessment, and a variety of Internet resources. Broadly defined, educational technology also refers to the application of science. For example, learning theories often suggest specific procedures and strategies for teaching and assessment. The systematic application of these procedures is a form of educational technology. </p>

	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">Given the influence of technology on today&#39;s learner, it is important for teachers to become familiar with digital technologies and to learn how they can best be used in the classroom. A wide variety of resources are available for this purpose (for example, Teacher Vision, 2018; Bender &amp; Waller, 2013). (See <em>In the Classroom: Web 2.0 Tools&#8212;and Beyond</em>.)</p>
	 <p class="txt">Also, learners can no longer be viewed simply as passive recipients of information. </p>
	 <p class="key-point">Technology transforms learners from <em>consumers</em> of educational offerings to <em>collaborators</em> in the teaching&#8211;learning enterprise. However, both students and teachers should use caution when engaging with educational technology, for it can easily be misused to hide and even to promote educational shortcomings (Gee, 2013). </p>
	 <p class="txt">Those who rely on Internet resources&#8212;especially blogs and other forms of social media&#8212;for truth can easily be duped and manipulated. Students need to learn how to sift and skim through the enormous morass of digital offerings they encounter, so that they might learn to recognize truth at least occasionally.</p>

	 <p class="txt">Web 2.0 tools are designed for full-motion video, 3-D animation, and learner&#8211;web interaction (as opposed to Web 1.0, which was far more linear, less interactive, and geared mainly for business uses such as computing and data storage). Perhaps soon, we will venture beyond Web 2.0 to Web 3.0, which will give us an Internet universe that will be even freer, fairer, more transparent, more private, easily accessible, inexpensive, and antimonopoly (Zago, 2018). These digital tools are enormously useful for teachers and learners, for whom an enormous variety of web-based resources are available. It&#39;s important to realize, however, that these web-based sites, a few of which are listed in this box, are in a constant state of flux: They come and go with alarming frequency. However, a quick Internet search will uncover hundreds of other sites, many of them free. </p>

	 <h2 class="h2">Computer-Adaptive Testing</h2>
	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">An important development in current approaches to assessment that is especially relevant for today&#39;s digital learner is <strong>computer-adaptive testing</strong>; also sometimes referred to as <em>comput</em><em>erized</em> adaptive testing. Computer-adaptive testing describes a computer-based test in which the learner&#39;s skills and abilities determine the questions that make up the test (Weiss, 2014). </p>
	 <p class="txt">Consider what might happen, for example, when a skilled interviewer is asked to find out how much an applicant knows in a given area. The first question an interviewer asks might be a moderately easy one. If the interviewee answers correctly, the next question is likely to be more demanding. Perhaps it will ask for more detail and hence a greater depth of understanding. But if the applicant responds uncertainly or incorrectly, the next question might be simpler or might move to a different area of expertise.</p>
	 <p class="txt">The point is that skilled interviewers do not ask every applicant exactly the same questions in the same order. Instead, they tailor questions to the applicant&#39;s responses. As a result, they gather a great deal of information with just a few questions, wasting little of their time or the interviewee&#39;s time.</p>

		 <a id="p124"></a>
	 <p class="txt">Traditional tests do not parallel the behavior of the skilled interviewer. They ask all learners to respond to the same questions in the same order. This format can present a number of distinct problems and disadvantages. Those of lower ability become frustrated at having to answer increasingly difficult items that are beyond their capabilities. And those of higher ability become bored and distracted by having to attend to a series of simple questions.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Computer-adaptive testing is designed to reduce these problems by adjusting test items to the examinee&#39;s ability. Tests are generally based on a large number of items that have been developed and tested with representative samples. Examiners analyze each question carefully so that they know not only what the items test but how difficult each item is likely to be for any given group of learners. The items then become part of a computer-administered test in which the computer is programmed to function much like a skilled interviewer might.</p>

     <div class="single-column">
	<h3 class="h3">Available Computer-Adaptive Tests</h3>

	 <p class="txt">Among commercially available computer-adaptive tests are assessments produced by the SmarterBalanced Assessment Consortium (2018). These are an extensive library of online, computer-administered assessments aligned with common core standards. Some of the SmarterBalanced assessments can be administered periodically during the school year and used for formative purposes. Also available are summative, end-of-year tests for grades 3, 8, and 11 in mathematics and English language arts. The summative tests include both performance tasks and a computer-adaptive test. The performance task requires students to write an essay, which is computer scored. The computer-adaptive test follows this general procedure:</p> 

	 <p class="txt">The computer begins by selecting an item of moderate difficulty based on previous analyses of item difficulty.</p>

	 <ol class="nl">
	 <li class="li_text">The item is presented to the testee.</li>

	 <li class="li_text">The computer evaluates the testee&#39;s ability based on the response to this first item.</li>

	 <li class="li_text">The computer selects the next item so that if the testee&#39;s response was incorrect, the next item is simpler; if it is correct, the next item will be more difficult.</li>

	 <li class="li_text">Following the second question, the computer now reevaluates the examinee&#39;s ability on the basis of responses to both items and selects the next item accordingly.</li>

	 <li class="li_text">Subsequent items are selected according to the testee&#39;s history of responses on all preceding items.</li>
			 </ol>

			 <p class="txt">Among the advantages of computer-adaptive testing is that it tends to provide highly precise scores for all ability levels. Because far fewer items are typically involved than in a more traditional approach to testing, fatigue and frustration are less likely to be factors. In addition, testing time is generally much shorter because the same amount of information can be gathered with far fewer items. Also, the possibility of presenting graphics, sound, and animation provides for novel and potentially advantageous methods of assessment. </p>
	 <p class="txt">Another good example of computer-adaptive testing is the <strong>DIBELS system</strong> (Dynamic Indicators of Basic Early Literacy Skills). Different forms of this test are designed to measure early language literacy, primarily for ELL students, as well as math and reading. Test items are generally very short, and selection of items is determined by the examinee&#39;s responses. (Examples of standardized, computer-adaptive intelligence and achievement tests are discussed in Chapter 10.)</p>

	 <a id="p125"></a>
	 <h3 class="h3">Limitations of Computer-Adaptive Testing</h3>

			 <p class="txt">Computer-adaptive testing does have a number of disadvantages, however. Because a large number of items have to be prepared, administered, and analyzed, it is far more expensive and time-consuming to prepare a good adaptive test than a traditional test. And in many areas, such as English literature or history for example, it is difficult to develop items that are relatively sequential in terms of difficulty. Also, the reliability of adaptive tests is not easy to establish, given that different learners essentially take different tests. The fact that every learner might, in the end, be given a different test also leads to the possibility of real or perceived unfairness. </p>
	 <p class="txt">Keep in mind, too, that the &quot;computer&quot; involved in computer-adaptive testing is really just the software that some programmer devised to direct the machine&#39;s interaction with the learner. Therefore, the computer is subject to all the errors that the programmer made. <strong>Weinberg&#39;s second law</strong> is relevant here: <em>If builders built buildings the way programmers wrote programs, </em><em>then the first woodpecker that came along would destroy civilization</em> (as cited in Chemuturi, 2010, p. ix). Still, as we will see in Chapter 10, for today&#39;s net generation learner, computer-adaptive testing may be a better approach than a more conventional paper-and-pencil test.</p>

	 </div>
	 <div class="section-lead"> 
		 <p class="intro">It bears repeating that schools have important functions other than simply stuffing long-term memories with knowledge. An old Chinese proverb comes to mind: Give someone a fish and you will feed them for a day, but teach them how to fish and you will feed them for a lifetime. </p>
	 </div>


	<div class="section-body">
    <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">Among other things, part of the school&#39;s responsibility is to foster in learners the development of the skills and strategies that are fundamental to learning how to learn. </p>
	 <p class="key-point">Teaching children how to learn&#8212;and helping them develop into self-directed, autonomous learners&#8212;may, in the final analysis, be far more important than the vast amounts of information with which schools typically bombard students.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Learning how to learn in schools is not entirely new. What is new, however, is a change in our beliefs about what makes learning easy or difficult. Not many decades ago, psychologists and educators tended to assume that the most important factor in learning is inherited intelligence&#8212;taking into account, of course, that persistence, motivation, values, and other characteristics are also important. </p>
	 <p class="txt">In recent years, however, our views of intelligence have changed dramatically, as is illustrated by Carol Dweck&#39;s work on <em>mindsets</em>. Both children and adults typically have one of two views (<em>mindsets</em>) with respect to intelligence. We tend to view intelligence as something that is fixed and cannot change (<em>fixed mindset</em>). Or we view intelligence as malleable&#8212;as something that can be improved with dedication and hard work (<em>growth mindset</em>; Dweck, 2017; Dweck &amp; Molden, 2017; Haimovitz &amp; Dweck, 2017).</p>
	 
	 <a id="p126"></a>
	 <p class="txt">These mindsets have enormous implications for our motivation and behavior. Those who believe that intelligence is fixed and unlikely to change will make little effort to increase it. When they find a task too difficult, they are more likely to give up than try mastering it. On the other hand, those with a growth mindset are far more likely to persist when faced with difficult tasks. They are more willing to accept challenges and to work toward increasing their knowledge, skills, and intellectual competence.</p>
	 <p class="txt">The evidence now seems clear that intelligence is not a fixed quality. When we measure intelligence, we measure a variety of components, many of them largely learned (Sternberg, 2015b; see Chapter 10). Among these components are a variety of cognitive learning and memory strategies such as those having to do with rehearsing, organizing, summarizing, practicing, and so on. And because these strategies are learned, they can also be taught. </p>
	 <p class="key-point">One of the teacher&#39;s responsibilities is to teach these strategies to encourage learners to develop growth rather than fixed mindsets.</p>
	 <p class="txt">These notions have led to an expanding field of research in education that examines how schools can help children learn how to learn. Researchers have developed a range of programs designed specifically to teach students how to learn and think. Nickerson (1988, 2008) notes that these programs emphasize a variety of skills, including the following:</p>

	 <ul class="bl">
	 <li class="li_text">basic strategies such as rehearsal, elaboration, and organization, all of which are fundamental to long-term memory</li>
	 <li class="li_text">skills involved in abstracting, reflecting, and making critical judgments </li>
	 <li class="li_text">domain-specific knowledge (e.g., specific information in history or basic approaches to mathematical problems)</li>
	 <li class="li_text">knowledge about reasoning principles (e.g., the rules of logic)</li>
	 <li class="li_text">knowledge about principles of thinking that might be used in solving problems</li>
	 <li class="li_text">metacognitive approaches that encourage students to become aware of their mental processes and their learning and thinking strategies</li>
	 <li class="li_text">assessment procedures that measure the extent to which students are learning to&nbsp;learn</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p class="txt">Some of the programs and approaches that have resulted from these various emphases are highly complex and attempt to teach cognitive skills as a separate subject. Others are less formal and tend to occur in the course of teaching other subjects. One example is a study by Gamino, Chapman, Hull, and Lyon (2010) in which they succeeded in improving memory and reasoning ability in a group of 54 eighth-grade students by teaching them strategies that promoted abstracting meaning from written material. Another example is provided by Motes and associates (2018), who increased performance in older adults by providing them with cognitive strategies training over a 12-week period. Strategies that were taught included attention-focusing strategies, reasoning techniques, and ways of innovating.</p>

	 <div class="inner-section">
	 <h2 class="h2">Research-Based Classroom Applications</h2>

	 <div class="single-column">
	 <p class="txt">There is no doubt that effective teaching of cognitive skills and strategies requires knowing how children learn and remember. The point was made earlier in this chapter, but it bears repeating:</p>
	 <p class="tx"><em>Student learning is a central instructional goal; the purpose of educational </em><em>assessment is to foster the attainment of instructional goals and to measure </em><em>the extent to which they are being met; therefore, educational assessment must </em><em>promote and measure student learning. . . . Those who would master the arts of </em><em>educational assessment must first know about human learning.</em></p>
	 <p class="txt">Does what we know about learning, remembering, and cognitive science have any implications for teaching and learning in schools? According to Brown, Roediger, and McDaniel (2014), there are clear educational applications implicit in cognitive science research on learning, memory, and cognitive processing. In their words, there are ways of &quot;making it stick.&quot; They claim, &quot;The most effective learning strategies are not intuitive,&quot; adding that as a result, &quot;people generally are going about learning in the wrong ways&quot; (Brown et al., 2014, p. ix). The most common methods of learning, and the teaching methods that are most often used to foster them, are based on intuition and folklore. These include methods like rehearsing and repeating information or skills over and over or rereading the same material again and again. These processes, Brown and associates claim, lead to a form of self-deception: After a while, the repeated materials and skills become so familiar that the individual develops what Brown and associates call <em>the illusion of knowing</em>. Memorization and repetition work to an extent, but they are not the same as true mastery, understanding, or knowledge of a subject or skill. </p>
	 <p class="txt">The most effective approaches to learning, explain Brown et al. (2014), are based on cognitive science and research. These approaches include the following strategies.</p>

 
	<ol class="nl">

	 <li class="li_text"><strong><em>Spaced repetition:</em></strong> Instead of repeating the material or practicing the skill for long, uninterrupted periods (termed <strong>blocked repetition</strong>), learners are encouraged to leave the material and periodically return to it.</li>
	 <li class="li_text"><em>Interleaving:</em> Also highly effective is <strong>interleaving</strong>&#8212;a strategy in which the learner practices different skills or studies different material simultaneously, periodically leaving a learning task to work on a second or maybe even a third, then going back to the first, and so on, thus <em>interleaving</em> two or more unrelated activities. Research indicates that interleaving can be highly effective in schools (Pan, 2015; Rohrer, Dedrick, &amp; Stershic, 2015).</li>
	 <li class="li_text"><em>Memorizing:</em> It might seem that if higher cognitive processes such as those involved in analyzing, evaluating, synthesizing, and creating are of paramount importance, memorizing would be far less important. But no, say Brown et al. (2014): If learners are to be successful in applying the cognitive processes at play in analysis or synthesis, they need to have learned and be able to recall a host of procedures and facts.</li>
	 <li class="li_text"><em>The </em><strong><em>testing effect:</em></strong> Testing improves retention, claim Brown and associates (2014). That&#39;s because testing, which includes both formal tests and informal assessments that might take the form of questions, quizzes, and brief assignments, requires recall and, therefore, repetition. But this kind of repetition is quite different from repeated drill and practice. The testing effect describes recall that illustrates spaced or interleaved retrieval, both of which have been shown to be highly effective teaching/learning strategies.</li>
	 
	 </ol>

	<a id="p128"></a>
	 <p class="txt">Another very useful summary of research that looks at the effectiveness of different learning techniques based on findings in cognitive and educational psychology is provided by Dunlosky, Rawson, Marsh, Nathan, and Willingham (2013). They looked at research that had studied the effectiveness and generalizability of 10 distinct learning techniques, ranking these techniques in terms of whether their usefulness was high, moderate, or low. Some of their conclusions are summarized in Table 3.3. Note that, like Brown and associates, they found that distributed practice and testing (termed <em>practice testing</em>) were both highly effective.</p>

	 <p class="txt">John Hattie (2009) synthesized more than 800 meta-analyses of studies that have looked at the factors that influence school achievement. A <strong>meta-analysis</strong> is a study that combines the results of many related studies that have looked at similar questions, analyzing them in an effort to uncover the most general and valid conclusions that can be based on the research. A second study by Hattie (2015a) synthesized 1,200 meta-analyses that looked at what influences achievement in higher education.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Hattie&#39;s synthesis relating to school achievement included more than 50,000 separate studies with combined samples of perhaps as many as 236 million students (Hattie, 2009). In general, these studies looked at the contributions of six different factors to achievement: the child, the home, the school, the curricula, the teacher, and approaches to teaching. </p>
	 <p class="key-point">The research seems clear that teachers and pupils are among the most powerful influences in school learning. And of the two, students&#8212;particularly their prior cognitive abilities&#8212;are the most important influence.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Teachers are second in the magnitude of their contribution to the education of students, both at higher education and school levels. As Hattie (2009) puts it, &quot;[Excellence in education] is about how teachers and students strategize, think about, play with, and build conceptions about worthwhile knowledge and understanding. Monitoring, assessing, and evaluating the progress in this task is what then leads to the power of feedback&quot; (p. 238). </p>

	 <a id="p129"></a>
	 <p class="txt">Feedback, Hattie (2012) informs us, is another major influence on learning. Feedback, as we have seen, is essential to good formative assessment. One type of feedback, extensively investigated by Skinner, takes the form of reinforcement. Basically, positive and negative reinforcement both say, &quot;You are doing well. Do continue.&quot; Punishment says the opposite. And, in general, the ongoing formative assessments that tell the learner and the teacher that progress is being made toward agreed-upon goals is feedback that supports ongoing efforts. This kind of feedback might be considered reinforcement for current approaches to teaching and learning. Assessments that tell learners and teachers that progress is stopped, sidetracked, derailed, or reversed do not reinforce ongoing efforts but may lead to modifications in approaches.</p>
	 <p class="txt">Among the important conclusions that Hattie (2009) derived from his synthesis is the identification of what he refers to as the six &quot;signposts&quot; toward excellence in education. These are summarized in Figure 3.14. </p>

	 <h2 class="h2">Themes</h2>
	 <div class="single-column">
	 <h3 class="h3"> Learning and Educational Assessment</h3>
	 <p class="txt">Learning may involve changes in disposition and capability that are potentially observable in performance. The goal of education is to promote learning; among the important purposes of assessment are to foster and enhance motivation and achievement and to determine the extent to which goals are being met; hence, educational assessment must measure student learning&#8212;and those responsible for assessment need to know how students learn.</p>

	 <h3 class="h3">Classical and Operant Conditioning</h3>
	 <p class="txt">Classical conditioning (Pavlov, Watson) looks at simple learning as a function of the repeated pairing of stimuli (contiguity explanations). Skinner&#39;s theory of operant conditioning builds on the notion that behaviors are controlled by their consequences (positive and negative reinforcement or the more aversive consequences of punishment). Feedback in educational assessment&#8212;especially in formative assessment&#8212;is an important source of reinforcement and guidance.</p>

	 <h3 class="h3">Cognitive Science</h3>
	 <p class="txt">Classical and operant conditioning theories are <em>behavioristic</em> theories (concerned with observable behaviors). Cognitive theories are more concerned with higher mental processes such as thinking, problem solving, concept formation, and other forms of information processing. The methods we use to monitor, direct, and improve our mental functioning are cognitive strategies. Our knowledge about our own mental functioning defines <em>metacognition</em>. There is evidence from a large number of achievement studies that the best teachers are those who pay the greatest attention to the development of abstract concepts and higher level cognitive skills among learners.</p>

 
 <h3 class="h3">Learning and Memory</h3>
	 <p class="txt">A widely accepted model of memory describes three memory stages: <em>sensory memory</em> (the momentary, unconscious effect of stimulation); <em>working</em> (<em>short-term</em>) <em>memory</em> (immediate awareness brought about when we pay attention to stimulation and maintain it in consciousness so that it can be processed for further storage or discarded); and <em>long-term memory</em> (the relatively permanent effects of experience). Long-term memories are labeled <em>declarative</em> (or <em>explicit</em>) when they can be verbalized, and <em>nondeclarative</em> (<em>implicit</em>) when they cannot be put into words. Declarative long-term memories may be <em>semantic</em> (stable, abstract knowledge) or <em>episodic</em> (autobiographical, dealing with personal experiences and tied to specific times and places.) Two important goals of schools are to teach for long-term memory and to teach learners how to learn. Our assessment procedures must foster these goals.</p>

	 <h3 class="h3">Today&#39;s Learners and Technology</h3>
	 <p class="txt">Today&#39;s learner is of the <em>net generation</em>, reared with a vast array of digital technologies. These technologies, along with other social and cultural changes, have resulted in a learner who is accustomed to receiving information extraordinarily rapidly, is easily distracted, multitasks easily, thinks learning should be fun, has little patience for long oral lessons, is more accustomed to discovering than to being told, and is used to high-impact, multimodal input. Some fear that technology may lead to the loss of some cognitive skills while improving others. One application of these technologies is computer-adaptive testing, which tailors the test to the examinee.</p>

<a id="p131"></a>
	 <h3 class="h3">Teaching Cognitive Strategies and Skills </h3>
	 <p class="txt">Some people view intelligence as fixed and unchanging (<em>fixed</em> mindset); others recognize that it is malleable and subject to improvement with effort and dedication (<em>growth</em> mindset). Mindset has important implications for motivation and behavior. Cognitive science research suggests that among the most effective learning strategies are <em>spaced repetition</em> (distributed practice), <em>interleaving</em>, and the use of <em>testing</em>.</p>
