      <h4>Figure 1.1 Uses of assessment in the classroom</h4>
      <p>The terms <em>summative</em>, <em>formative</em>, <em>diagnostic</em>, and <em>placement</em> refer to how
        assessment is used rather than to different kinds of assessment procedures. In each case, assessment might be
        structured and formal or highly informal. Although an assessment procedure might seem mainly summative,
        formative, or intended for placement decisions, the overriding purpose of educational assessment is to improve
        student learning.</p>
