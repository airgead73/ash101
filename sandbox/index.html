        <p class="txt">People, too, sometimes give the wrong answers on tests because they get nervous and scared.
          That&#39;s what often happened to Jacob. Tests scared the pants off him. When he sat down to take one, he
          would quickly forget every sensible thought and well-memorized fact he had stuffed into his brain. His test
          results were a disaster. They greatly chagrined his mother&mdash;especially when, following a series of
          countywide achievement tests, the principal called her in.</p>
        <p class="txt">&quot;Jacob should probably stop dreaming about going to university and becoming a
          professor,&quot; said the principal. &quot;There&#39;s other stuff he can do.&quot;</p>
        <p class="txt">But Jacob didn&#39;t stop dreaming. He just kept trying to educate himself. &quot;They
          can&#39;t teach me more stuff just by giving me more tests,&quot; he declared. &quot;That&#39;s about as
          sensible as thinking you can make yourself thinner just by weighing yourself a lot.&quot;</p>

          about?</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Jacob was a bright young man (his uncle once described him as having a brain as big as a planet).
        But he suffered from what psychologists label <strong>test anxiety</strong>.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">The mere thought of any sort of assessment, and the fear that he would not do well, invariably
          led to a frayed emotional state that interfered with Jacob&#39;s ability to perform well on tests. As he
          explained it, school assessments made him feel like a cat that is falling with its back to the ground and just
          can&#39;t seem to get its feet pointed the right way.</p>
        <p class="txt">Assessment can be like that for some students&mdash;highly threatening and anxiety provoking.
          This is especially the case when the student&#39;s performance has profound implications, not only for the
          learner but perhaps also for the teacher, the school, the parents, and others. Such situations are labeled
          <strong>high-stakes testing</strong> environments (these are discussed more in Chapter 10).</p>
        <p class="txt">But assessment in many of today&#39;s schools is very different from what it was in Jacob&#39;s
          school, which at the time was more focused on performance. </p>
        <p class="key-point">In fact, the best current approaches to classroom assessment are designed less to determine
          how well or how poorly students perform and more to help them learn.</p>
        <p class="txt">Such approaches to testing might well have uncovered Jacob&#39;s problem and helped him before he
          abandoned all hope.</p>
        <p class="txt">This chapter looks at current approaches to educational assessment and its various purposes and
          forms. It explains how assessment is driven by the main, overriding goals of the educational enterprise, how
          curricula are designed around these goals, and how assessments are used to gauge the extent to which goals are
          being met. It looks at the implications of various pieces of legislation that direct and influence educational
          endeavors. It examines some of the rules and regulations designed to ensure that assessments are as fair,
          useful, and ethical as possible. Finally, it looks at what we know about approaches that work in education.

          purposes of educational assessment? How are summative, formative, and placement assessments different?</span>
      </h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Educational assessment has two broad purposes: The most important, strongly reflected in
        today&#39;s assessment literature, is to improve teaching and learning (e.g., Stiggins &amp; Chappuis, 2017).
        That purpose is emphasized throughout this text. The second purpose is to measure student achievement in order
        to provide a grade.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <h2 class="h2">Summative Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">Assessment that is mainly used to provide a midterm or year-end grade, or to assess mastery
          at the end of a unit, is called <strong>summative assessment</strong>.</p>
        <p class="txt">Summative assessment has traditionally been the main function of testing in schools, partly
          because its historical emphasis has been on sorting learners to select those with the highest probability of
          future success. Selecting students is no longer the principal mission of our schools, as Stiggins and Chappuis
          (2017) explain.</p>
        <p class="key-point">Schools increasingly need to ensure that learners know how to learn&mdash;that they become
          competent, self-directed learners who are actively involved in their own education.</p>
      </div>


      <div class="text_container">
        <h4><button class="ec_expand" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="ecbox1-1">LEARN MORE</button></h4>
        <div id="ecbox1-1">
          <div class="single-column">

            <p class="tx">Yesterday&#39;s approaches to education do not work well for schools&#39; new mission or for
              today&#39;s students, argues Prensky (2011, 2012a, 2012b).</p>
            <p class="tx">Today&#39;s learners are very different: They are members of what is sometimes labeled the
              <strong>net generation</strong> (Oblinger &amp; Oblinger, 2005), also called <em>Generation Z</em>,
              <em>iGen</em>, <em>post-millennials</em>, or a variety of other terms. These learners are so profoundly
              influenced by digital technologies (such as the Internet, video games, and computers) that they think and
              learn differently than did older generations of students. (We look at some characteristics of today&#39;s
              learners and at how these impact learning and assessment in Chapter 3).</p>
            <p class="tx">Because today&#39;s learners are different, and because what we expect of our schools is also
              different, contemporary emphases in education are changing. They reflect our beliefs and intentions
              regarding the main purpose of school. Today&#39;s model is more egalitarian: It advocates success for all
              rather than for a chosen few. Furthermore, educators such as Prensky (2016) strongly argue that education
              should focus less on improving individuals and more on improving the world. In his words, &quot;Kids now
              need an education that is far more connected and real than in the past&mdash;an education that gives them
              not only knowledge, but also provides them with empowerment and agency&quot; (Prensky, 2016, p. 1). </p>
            <p class="tx">Accordingly, today&#39;s teacher views assessment mainly as a tool to provide guidance and
              assistance; to make today&#39;s student a highly competent, self-motivated, lifelong learner. The hope is
              that this learner will also be imbued with the motivation and passion to make the world a better place.

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Assessment designed to improve the teaching/learning process is called <strong>formative
              assessment</strong>. It consists of the huge variety of methods teachers use to assess and assist learner
            progress and comprehension during a lesson, course, or unit. </p>
          <p class="key-point">Put another way, formative assessment is assessment <em>for</em> learning; summative
            assessment is assessment <em>of</em> learning.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Characteristics</h3>
          <p class="txt">Formative assessment is that which is embedded in the teaching&ndash;learning process. Much of
            it is informal rather than structured and formal. It has the following features:</p>
          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">It consists of ongoing strategies such as questions, quizzes, and observation of student
              performances and products.</li>
            <li class="li_text">It involves providing frequent and timely feedback aimed directly at improving teaching
              and learning.</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="key-point">Instead of summarizing achievement with a number or grade (summative assessment),
            formative assessment provides information that a teacher and learner can put to use before formal grading
            occurs.</p>
          <h3 class="h3">Key to Assessment in Schools</h3>
          <p class="txt">As Hattie (2012) puts it, &quot;The primary function of assessment is to support learning by
            generating feedback that students can act upon in terms of where they are going, how they are going there,
            and where they might go next&quot; (p. 126). </p>
          <p class="key-point">Hence, the primary purpose of assessment in schools is (or should be) formative.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 class="h2">Placement Assessment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">As the name implies, <strong>placement assessment</strong> is designed to provide
          information relating to a learner&#39;s placement.</p>

        <p class="txt">It typically occurs prior to an instructional sequence and looks at the learner&#39;s readiness
          for a lesson, unit, course, or entire program. </p>

        <p class="txt">Placement assessment often includes <strong>diagnostic assessment</strong>, which is directed
          specifically at identifying learning strengths or problems and their underlying causes. For example,
          diagnostic assessment might be used to determine whether a learner would benefit from being placed in a group
          that receives remedial instruction in reading or mathematics. </p>

        <p class="txt">Of course, the fact that both learners and educational emphases are changing does not mean that
          all teachers stress the formative role of assessment over its summative uses. Some critics point out that many
          of today&#39;s schools still reflect the approaches and emphases of the past. Groshell (2017), for example,
          notes that although there have been enormous advances in both technology and educational goals, relatively
          little has changed regarding how schools view learning and how they design the learning environment. Still,
          there is little doubt that the uses and purposes of educational assessment are changing&mdash;and even less
          doubt that they should.</p>
      </div>

      <a id="p5"></a>
      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Performance-Based Assessment</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Another important category of educational assessment is <strong>performance-based
              assessment</strong>. </p>

          <p class="key-point">Performance-based assessments ask learners to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and
            understanding by actually performing a task or producing a product that directly illustrates what is being
            assessed. </p>

          <p class="txt">Thus, performance-based assessments can be used for both formative and summative purposes. </p>

          <p class="txt">For example, asking first grader William to read aloud from one of the work sheets that
            accompanies the <em>Beginning Reader</em> series is a performance-based assessment. Judging William&#39;s
            performance according to a <strong>rubric</strong>, a type of scoring guide described in Chapter 7 and shown
            in Table 1.1, provides a basis for using the descriptor <em>Meets Standard</em> on his electronic report
            card. This would be an example of using performance assessment for <em>summative</em> purposes.</p>

      <h2 class="h2"> Bringing It All Together </h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">To summarize: As Figure 1.1 illustrates, assessment might occur before instruction and could be
          the basis for decisions regarding a learner&#39;s placement (placement assessment). Placement assessment might
          also involve <em>diagnostic assessment</em>, the main purpose of which is to identify a learner&#39;s
          strengths and weaknesses, diagnose learning problems, and even uncover the reasons for them.]</p>

        <a id="p6"></a>
        <p class="txt">Assessment that occurs during instruction is <em>formative</em> to the extent that it provides
          feedback to assist in the learning process. Formative assessment is an integral part of the
          teaching&ndash;learning process, rather than something that occurs only before or after instruction.
          Assessment that occurs after instruction is usually <em>summative</em>: Its purpose is to summarize learner
          progress and achievement. Formative assessment is further discussed in Chapter 5; summative assessment is
          detailed in Chapter 6; and performance-based assessment is the subject of Chapter 7.</p>

              assessment procedure might seem mainly summative, formative, or intended for placement decisions, the
              overriding purpose of educational assessment is to improve student learning.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="single-column">
          <h3 class="h3">Test</h3>

          <p class="key-point">In education, the word <strong>test</strong> typically refers to specific instruments or
            procedures designed to measure student achievement or progress, or to identify various student
            characteristics. </p>

          <p class="txt"><strong>Tests</strong> typically consist of a sample of behaviors (responses) that serve as a
            basis for making inferences. For example, a ninth-grade algebra final test does not examine students&#39;
            complete body of algebraic knowledge or their ability to solve all problems related to the entire course.
            Instead, the test consists of a representative sample of problems. If a student responds correctly to 84% of
            the problems, the examiner infers that the student also would have responded correctly to 84% of the entire
            pool of relevant problems. </p>

          <p class="txt">Test results are often <em>quantitative</em> in that they provide a numerical measure, such as
            90%, or a grade with clear meaning, such as a B. However, sometimes they are <em>qualitative</em>, in that
            they describe some particular quality such as <em>Meeting all standards</em> or <em>Excellent descriptive
            </em><em>paragraph</em>. Whether tests are developed by the teacher or are commercially prepared, they are a
            relatively formal approach to assessment. They are commonly used in placement and summative assessment but
            less so in formative assessment, which tends to be more informal.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Measurement</h3>

          <p class="txt">Measurements are usually quantitative: They are used to indicate an amount. Thus, I
            <em>measure</em> the length of my foot in inches or centimeters; but I can <em>test</em> its suitability for
            running by putting it through a series of movements. </p>

          <p class="key-point"><strong>Measurement </strong>in education is usually based on the results of tests.
            Strictly speaking, educational measurement is a set of procedures for manipulating and interpreting test
            results. </p>

          <p class="txt">For example, educational measurement might involve making decisions about specific levels of
            performance that are acceptable in a unit test or that identify learners who need assistance.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Assessment</h3>

          <p class="txt"><em>Assessment</em> is a more general term. </p>

          <a id="p9"></a>
          <p class="key-point">In an educational setting, <strong>assessment</strong> refers to all the
            activities&mdash;including testing and measuring&mdash;undertaken by a teacher to obtain information about
            students&#39; characteristics, their progress and achievement, and the effectiveness of instructional
            methods in relation to desired outcomes. </p>

          <p class="txt">There is a strong belief that in the 21st century, assessment should be a collaborative process
            that engages both learner and teacher, and perhaps involves parents as well. In this sense, assessment
            reflects a commitment to achievement and progress, and recognizes that assessment-based feedback is an
            essential component of the teaching&ndash;learning cycle. </p>

          <p class="txt">Educational assessment is no longer viewed as a mysterious, secretive, teacher-controlled
            process. Today&#39;s learner should be able to access assessment-based, formative feedback in collaboration
            with the teacher&mdash;perhaps by means of face-to-face interactions or via online, digital technology.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Evaluation</h3>

          <p class="txt">Literally, <em>evaluation</em> refers to the process of making a value judgment. It may involve
            deciding that something is good or bad, moral or immoral, effective or ineffective. </p>

          <p class="txt">In education, however, evaluation is seldom as subjective as this definition might imply.</p>

          <p class="key-point"><strong>Evaluation </strong>is usually based on the results of one or more assessments,
            and it often takes the form of an appraisal based on whether certain criteria have been met. </p>

          <p class="txt">For example, determining whether a student qualifies for special needs services in primary
            grades usually requires the use of specific evaluation criteria related to speech and language difficulties,
            social and emotional problems, or behavioral problems.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Grade</h3>

          <p class="key-point"><strong>Grades</strong> are generally numbers, letters, or verbal descriptors that
            describe a particular rank or quality. </p>

          <p class="txt">Thus, there are different grades of beef, lumber, wheat, paper&mdash;and even students. </p>

          <p class="key-point">In education, grades are summative rather than formative. </p>

          <p class="txt">They are usually based on the results of tests or on other forms of assessment. Occasionally,
            as we will see in Chapter 11, they might also reflect other factors such as performance on assignments or
            class participation. </p>

      <h2 class="h2"> What We Measure</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Assessments, measurements, and evaluations are a huge part of everyday life. You have been

        <p class="key-point">In many ways, life is a series of formal and informal assessments.</p>

        <p class="txt">Some show how well you are performing compared to your peers; others appraise your performance
          relative to some standard or norm that describes expected or average behavior or achievement. </p>

        <p class="txt">And of course, the preschool and school experiences that follow bring with them a whole range of
          new assessments. At the very least, schools typically measure student achievement; most also assess various
          kinds of aptitude or ability. They might also examine personality, vocational and career interests, and
          performance in different subject areas. </p>

        <a id="p11"></a>

        <p class="txt">Some of the assessments used involve formal measuring instruments, often produced by professional
          test developers. Others are constructed by teachers. </p>

        <p class="txt">Often, too, assessment is based on more informal kinds of observations made both in and outside

        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">The chief purpose of any educational assessment is to foster learning. However, each of the
            broad assessment approaches described in Table 1.4 might serve a variety of purposes in the classroom,
            including the following.</p>
          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">determining whether learning goals are being met</li>

      <h2 class="h2"> What Information Learners Need</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Most of the uses for educational assessment are not mutually exclusive. A single,
          well-constructed, teacher-made, end-of-unit test might serve every one of the purposes just listed. </p>

        <p class="key-point">However, the kind of assessment information the learner needs is quite different from the
          assessment information that might be given to parents.</p>

        <p class="txt">Interested parties such as parents, prospective employers, and university admissions officers are
          mainly interested in summative information that allows them to compare and evaluate. That is, they want to
          know what the learner has achieved relative to educational goals and relative to other learners. On that
          basis, they can predict what the learner is capable of, provide advice about educational and career options,
          and make decisions about placement.</p>

        <p class="key-point">In contrast, what learners need in the day-to-day business of learning is immediate,
          personalized, confidential information about their learning. They need formative information that will enhance
          their ongoing development. </p>

      <p class="intro">Educational assessment has an enormous influence on what students study and how they&nbsp;learn.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Usually, students try to learn what they expect teachers to test&mdash;which is, presumably, what
          teachers teach.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">When Tests Don&#39;t Measure Up</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Unfortunately, teachers do not always test on what they claim is most important. For example,
            Elena&#39;s high school English teacher, Mr. Teske, constantly emphasizes the importance of critical
            thinking and independent reflection. He spends hours of class time analyzing and critiquing various literary
            works, speculating on the moral virtues of the characters, and asking students to offer personal opinions on
            abstract literary matters.</p>
          <p class="txt">But on Fridays, Mr. Teske routinely presents his learners with a fill-in-the-blank quiz that
            consists of questions like the following:</p>

          <a id="p13"></a>

          <p class="ext">The author of <em>Wuthering Heights</em> is _________.<br />
            The person who said, &quot;Beware the ides of March&quot; was _________.<br />

            <em>You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things! </em><br />
            <em>O you</em> ______________________________________<br />
            <em>Knew you not Pompey?</em></p>
          <p class="txt">Students quickly learn that if they are to do well, they should memorize as much as possible.
            Meanwhile, Mr. Teske&#39;s main objectives&mdash;teaching students how to think critically, reflect, analyze
            and synthesize, and evaluate&mdash;remain unrealized.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">The Importance of Educational Goals (Standards)</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point"><strong>Educational goals</strong> are the broad intentions of educational
          systems&mdash;the standards these systems are designed to reach. </p>
        <p class="txt">Educational goals describe what educational systems are designed to accomplish. They summarize
          the purposes of educational institutions and, indirectly, the goals that societies and parents have for
          children. Educational goals might be expressed in broad terms, such as &quot;The goal of education is to
          ensure that all students are taught to high academic standards.&quot; This is one of the important educational
          goals of the <strong>Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</strong> (2015; 2017), which is currently the main U.S.
          federal law governing K&ndash;12 education.</p>
        <p class="key-point">In much of the educational literature, the word <em>standard </em>is used interchangeably
          with the word <em>goal</em>, as it is in this text. </p>

        <div id="ecbox1-3">
          <div class="single-column">
            <p class="tx">On occasion, however, <em>standard</em> means a level of performance, as in <em>performing to
                a high standard</em>. Levels of performance are often described in terms of sequential steps that form a
              <em>learning progression</em>. A learning progression is a hierarchical succession of skills and knowledge
              that build toward a learning objective.</p>
            <p class="tx">The phrases <em>learning objective</em> and <em>instructional objective</em> (and sometimes
              <em>educational objective</em>) are used interchangeably: They denote the more specific objectives of the
              teaching/learning enterprise. In educational literature, a <em>criterion</em> is a measure or level to
              which performance can be compared and evaluated. Hence, <em>success criteria</em> denote specific
              conditions associated with desired or expected achievement. These important terms are defined and
              illustrated in Table 1.5.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Backward Design</h2>
        <div class="single-column">

          <p class="txt"><strong>Educational standards</strong> (goals) such as those described by ESSA are helpful for
            guiding the development of curricula and influencing the values of educators, and perhaps of students and
            parents as well. </p>
          <p class="key-point">In fact, one of the most useful approaches to designing a curriculum is to begin with its
            goals&mdash;a process known as <strong>backward design</strong>. </p>
          <p class="txt">The great value of the backward design approach is that it provides a clear, step-by-step
            method for determining what needs to be taught, how it can be assessed, and how best to assist learners in
            reaching curriculum objectives.</p>
          <p class="txt">One of the identifying characteristics of the backward design process is that learning
            objectives are derived directly from educational standards. </p>


          <h3 class="h3">The Process</h3>
          <p class="txt">The backward design process can be described in terms of three steps.</p>

          <ol class="nl">
            <li class="li_text">
              <p class="key-point">Decide on the end results (the goals or standards) that the curriculum is intended to
                achieve (specify learning objectives).</p>
            </li>
            <li class="li_text">
              <p class="key-point">Clarify how you will be able to determine that the desired end results have been

                (plan teaching/learning approaches).</p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <a id="p15"></a>
          <h3 class="h3">The Role of Assessment</h3>

          <p class="key-point">Assessment plays a critical role in the backward design process.</p>
          <p class="txt">Not only are assessment decisions made even before decisions about teaching and learning
            activities, but, as Wright (2006) points out, assessment results can also influence instructional
            approaches. This might occur, for example, when formative assessments reveal that many learners are
            struggling to reach learning objectives. </p>
          <p class="key-point">Assessment results can also influence the goals themselves.</p>
          <p class="txt">For example, if learning objectives remain out of reach even after using the most effective
            instructional approaches available, the objectives themselves might have to be changed. </p>
          <p class="txt">Although the backward design model for curriculum building, assessment, and instruction is
            presented as a series of steps, it is in some ways a cycle&mdash;as shown by the arrows in Figure&nbsp;1.3.

              <p class="caption">Although the backward design model is presented as three sequential steps, in some
                ways, it is a cycle rather than a straight line. As is shown by the arrows, assessment can provide
                information that might lead teachers to change their instructional approaches; it might also provide
                information that would result in a clarification or change of specific learning objectives.</p>

      <h2 class="h2">Collaboration in the Assessment Cycle</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Following passage of ESSA, individual states are now required to develop their own educational
          goals (standards), to select assessments that will allow them to determine if these standards are being met,
          and of course, to provide the kind of education that maximizes the likelihood of reaching these goals. As we
          will see later in this chapter, many states have adopted <em>common core standards</em> that have been
          developed by a national consortium of educators. Many also collaborate in developing and sharing relevant
          assessment and instructional materials, often through the formation of what is called a <strong>professional
            learning community (PLC)</strong>. </p>

        <a id="p16"></a>
        <h3 class="h3">What Is a PLC?</h3>

        <p class="txt">PLCs are formal associations of educators, and sometimes of parents, who come together to share
          ideas and resources relating to all things educational: goals, assessments, learning, and teaching. They often
          have members from different schools and sometimes even from different states. PLCs have become increasingly
          popular in recent decades as educational systems have faced increasing pressure to improve educational
          standards and student performance. They are now common worldwide and often feature international collaboration
          (Pang &amp; Wang, 2016).</p>

        <p class="txt">PLCs aim to set and clarify specific goals that relate to the high standards that most
          governments set for their schools. They also design curricula that incorporate these goals, develop assessment
          procedures that will allow educators and administrators to monitor progress toward the goals, and devise and
          implement instructional strategies that are most likely to provide every learner with an opportunity to reach
          the desired standards. </p>

        <h3 class="h3">How Might PLCs Use Backward Design?</h3>

        <p class="txt">Backward design provides a highly useful and systematic way to attack these issues. As a result,
          it has become an increasingly popular approach to the cycle of designing curricula, developing assessments,
          and implementing teaching strategies. For example, Paesani (2017) describes how a French language curriculum
          was backward designed based on <em>cultural liter</em><em>acy</em>, the overarching standard toward which the
          course was aimed. By relating specific course objectives to this broad concept, explains Paesani, educators
          were able to devise assessment and instructional approaches that greatly increased the likelihood that
          learners would, in fact, develop <em>cultural literacy</em> relating to the French language. </p>

        <p class="txt">Backward design approaches to specifying learning objectives, developing assessment programs, and
          planning instruction have also become increasingly prevalent in postsecondary institutions (e.g., Reynolds
          &amp; Kearns, 2017; Michael &amp; Libarkin, 2016).</p>

        <h3 class="h3">How Do Educators Write Specific Instructional Objectives?</h3>

        <p class="txt">Educational goals often reflect the broad, general intentions of educational endeavors. They are
          the <em>standards</em> to which ESSA refers: &quot;ESSA requires that states establish college- and
          career-ready standards and maintain high expectations when assessing all students against those
          standards&quot; (U.S. Department of Education, 2017a, p. 2). </p>

        <p class="txt">The problem for educators is that standards, such as ESSA&#39;s requirement that all learners
          achieve high English language proficiency, are not nearly as helpful in the day-to-day business of teaching as
          are more specific statements known as <strong>learning objectives</strong>&mdash;also commonly referred to as
          <strong>learning targets</strong> or <strong>instructional objectives</strong>. Learning targets describe what
          the teacher and the student aim to achieve. They are statements of what schools expect students to know or do.
        </p>

        <a id="p17"></a>
        <p class="key-point">Learning objectives tell the teacher the following:</p>
        <ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">What needs to be taught</li>
          <li class="li_text">What needs to be assessed</li>
          <li class="li_text">How it will be taught and assessed</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="txt"> Learning objectives often take the form of statements about what is expected of students once
          they have completed a lesson, unit, or entire course.</p>

        <p class="key-point">The most useful learning objectives for teaching and assessment don&#39;t describe a lesson
          or a course, but rather spell out the precise behaviors or skills that students should be able to perform
          following instruction.</p>

        <p class="txt">For this reason, learning objectives are sometimes called behavioral objectives. </p>

        <p class="txt">Consider the following two examples of instructional objectives.</p>
        <ol class="nl">
          <li class="li_text">The learner should be proficient in mathematics.</li>

        <p class="txt">The second of these objectives is more useful than the first because it states what the student

        <p class="txt">Not only do useful instructional objectives specify what the learner should be able to do, they
          also provide definite criteria for meeting goals. For example, consider these instructional objectives.</p>

        <ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">The learner will be able to input material using a blank keyboard.</li>
          <li class="li_text">On a 5-minute test using a blank keyboard, the learner will be able to input 40 words per
            minute with no more than three errors when transcribing a randomly assigned passage from <em>Catcher in the
              Rye</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="txt">The second of these statements establishes clear criteria for meeting instructional goals. As a
          result, it is more useful than the first for suggesting instructional and assessment procedures.</p>

        <p class="txt">Writing useful learning objectives requires specifying objectives in terms of measurable
          outcomes. This involves all components of the assessment cycle illustrated in Figure 1.4.</p>

        <p class="txt">Although precise, performance-oriented approaches to instructional objectives are most useful for
          guiding instruction and assessment, more generally phrased objectives can also be helpful. For example, Waugh
          and Gronlund (2013) suggest that teachers should express main objectives in general rather than specific
          terms. Each main objective can then be developed in terms of actual behaviors that reflect the more general
          objective. Examples of these actual behaviors can then be used as a basis for assessment. (Chapter 4 presents
          a more detailed description of instructional objectives.) </p>

        <p class="txt">Among other things, ESSA sets broad educational goals for all grade levels, makes individual
          states accountable for student achievement, and requires states to monitor student achievement (see Table 1.6
          for highlights). </p>
        <p class="txt">ESSA replaced the <strong>No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB)</strong> of 2002, which had similar
          goals for children but far more stringent assessment requirements. For example, under NCLB, all students were
          expected to pass end-of-year tests, a clearly unrealistic expectation. </p>
        <p class="txt">Also, NCLB required that each state develop its own tests; under ESSA, states are free to use
          nationally recognized tests such as the ACT and the SAT (both of which are standardized tests widely used for
          admission to college.) </p>

        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">One of the general requirements mandated by ESSA is that all states develop high academic
            standards, provide an opportunity for all learners to reach these goals, and develop assessments to monitor
            the extent to which goals are being reached. </p>
          <p class="key-point">A result of this legislation has been increased emphasis on <em>common </em>standards
            within and even across states.</p>
          <p class="txt">Common standards help ensure equity in education across states and prevent a fragmented
            educational experience for those students who move to new communities that might otherwise have their own
            unique standards&mdash;an increasingly common event in today&#39;s more mobile population. </p>

          <p class="txt">The <strong>Common Core State Standards (CCSS)</strong>&mdash;first introduced across the

            develop standards. </p>

            <div class="single-column">
              <h3 class="h3">The Development of Common Core</h3>
              <p class="tx">As part of an increasingly global society, students must compete against people from around
                the world for jobs. They need to have the knowledge, skills, and disposition to be successful in this
                changing world&mdash;skills such as those required for collaboration, critical thinking, communication,
                creativity, and innovation.</p>
              <p class="tx">As leaders across the country considered these issues, many recognized the need to move
                beyond individual state standards for learning. They concluded that states need to agree on common
                standards in education that allow all children to develop the skills and knowledge required for success
                in a global society, regardless of where they live. </p>
              <p class="tx">Two organizations, the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) and the National
                Governors Association Center for Best Practices, spearheaded a movement to bring state leaders,
                administrators, teachers, and other stakeholders together to design standards that are rigorous,
                innovative, and focused on the most important knowledge and skills required for today&#39;s students.
              </p>
              <p class="tx">The CCSS initiative sought feedback from parents, teachers, state leaders, and the general
                public. The standards were finalized in 2010 and revised again in 2017 (CCSSO, 2017). States were
                invited to adopt the CCSS, but the choice remains voluntary.</p>
              <p class="tx">For kindergarten through 12th grade, CCSS have been developed in the disciplines of
                English/Language Arts and Mathematics. These content areas were chosen due to the foundational aspect of
                these subjects. The CCSS are focused on establishing a balance between content knowledge and thinking
                skills.</p>

              <h3 class="h3">English/Language Arts</h3>
              <p class="tx">In English/Language Arts the standards are organized so that reading, writing, listening and
                speaking, and language cross all grade levels, with technology embedded in each component. Students are
                expected to read a variety of fiction and nonfiction genres from both print and nonprint sources and to
                think critically about the content of the reading. Even at the lower grade levels, students are
                encouraged to form opinions and support them and to develop writing skills for different purposes. Under
                the CCSS, students have multiple opportunities to engage in dialogue in a variety of formal and informal
                arenas as they practice both listening and speaking skills.</p>

              <h3 class="h3">Mathematics</h3>
              <p class="tx">Similar to the English/Language Arts Standards, Mathematics Standards require students to
                employ higher levels of thinking. In a global society, it is not enough that students master procedures
                for doing calculations, or what are known as <em>procedural</em> knowledge. They also need to be able to
                reason mathematically, solve problems, and use logic to deduce answers. They must also communicate their
                mathematical thinking and be able to justify their answers and solutions. Standards that attend to both
                procedural competence and conceptual understanding equip students with the ability to assess a
                situation, determine a plan of action, carry out that plan, and evaluate its effectiveness.</p>
              <p class="tx">The CCSS present a framework that can help unify the content knowledge and thinking skills
                students need in the 21st century. As states adopt these standards, they are helping ensure that all
                students get a high-quality education focused on developing the knowledge and skills required of
                contributing members in contemporary society.</p>

      <h2 class="h2"> Potential Obstacles With Common Standards </h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">As of 2016, 42 states had adopted the standards, often with minor changes (Korn, Gamboa, &amp;
          Polikoff, 2016). However, as more states adopt the CCSS, potential hurdles have appeared. </p>
        <p class="txt">One of these has to do with the costs of changing assessment systems and reporting student
          progress. Older methods of assessment tended to focus on recall and recognition. </p>
        <p class="key-point">But because new standards attempt to foster critical thinking and problem solving, new
          assessments need to be developed. In addition, teachers who have operated with standards that focus on
          discrete knowledge need to develop new tools for instruction. </p>
        <p class="txt">Specifically, they must develop materials that engage students in problems that do not always
          have a clear, correct answer. It has yet to be determined when these issues will be addressed and who will
          cover the costs.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2"> Use of Data Analytics</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">With the passage of ESSA, there is clearly less emphasis on standardized testing and on what is
            termed <em>high-stakes testing</em>&mdash;testing with potentially significant implications (see Chapter
            10). However, there is still a need for teachers, schools, and states to deliver the best educational
            experiences possible. </p>
          <p class="key-point">Tests serve an important function in this regard: They provide numerical data that can be
            analyzed, sorted, transformed, and otherwise manipulated to reveal key insights&mdash;a process that defines
            <strong>data analytics</strong>. </p>
          <p class="txt">The emphasis in data analytics&mdash;as opposed to data <em>analysis</em>&mdash;is on using
            information to make decisions. In education, data analytics uses statistics (see Chapter 9), computer
            programs, learning theories, and information from educational research to improve teaching and learning. The
            feature <em>Applications: Making Data-Driven Decisions</em> describes this in more detail.</p>

          <p class="tx">The concept of data-driven decision making is gaining wide acceptance among educators, parents,
            and policy makers. It involves using evidence, or data, to demonstrate that a decision or action is the best
            among available alternatives. </p>

          <p class="tx"><strong><em>Avoiding Subjective Feelings</em></strong></p>
          <p class="tx">In the past, schools have been known to operate on &quot;gut feelings.&quot; The teacher
            <em>feels</em> that students benefit when instruction is combined with music. The principal
            <em>believes</em> a certain reading program is best for the school. The board of education <em>thinks</em>
            that eliminating recess will improve test scores because more instructional time is available. </p>
          <p class="tx">However, given the obligation to prepare students for the 21st century and the goal of
            developing students who can flourish in a global society, we can no longer &quot;feel,&quot;
            &quot;believe,&quot; or &quot;think&quot;: We need to know. With data-driven decision making, teachers can
            conduct research within their classes to determine if, say, music truly does benefit students. Principals
            and boards of education read the research that has been done or systematically investigate a given topic so
            they have data on which to base their decisions.</p>

          <p class="tx"><strong><em>Supplying Evidence</em></strong></p>
          <p class="tx">Consider a local school that has received its third-grade students&#39; scores on a statewide
            assessment of science. The principal has shared the results with the school&#39;s four third-grade teachers
            and asked them to review the data. They lay out each individual teacher&#39;s classroom results and start
            looking for patterns. They consult the assessment&#39;s blueprints and determine that across the four
            classes, one strand from the science curriculum is problematic. All four classes did poorly on the
            Interrelationships in Earth/Space Systems strand. </p>
          <p class="tx">They discuss why this might have occurred and discover that for all the other science strands,
            they have ample supplemental teaching materials. However, for this strand, they are limited to their
            textbook for teaching the concepts in the state&#39;s standards. Armed with these data, they suggest to
            their principal that they need more materials, along with training on how to use them. Without data to
            support their request, their case would be far less convincing.</p>
          <p class="tx"><strong><em>Supplying Sufficient Evidence</em></strong></p>
          <p class="tx">However, as compelling as some evidence may be, it is important to exercise caution when
            employing data-driven decision making.</p>
          <p class="tx">For example, one data set is not enough. The third-grade teachers could strengthen their case by
            including further evidence that the Science strand is problematic. How did students perform during the
            actual science unit? Do their scores on quizzes and tests reflect the same low scores seen on the statewide
            assessment? Do the informal checks for understanding conducted while teaching indicate that students are
            confused or have misconceptions about the material?</p>
          <p class="tx">Quality data-driven decision making does not rely on a single data set from which to draw
            conclusions.</p>
          <p class="tx"><strong><em>Drawing Conclusions</em></strong></p>
          <p class="tx">In addition, having the data does not guarantee that the best decision will be made.</p>
          <p class="tx">In the third-grade scenario, the data point to a problem with the one Science strand. The
            teachers present evidence to their principal, hoping that she will reach the same conclusion they
            have&mdash;that more materials and training are needed.</p>
          <p class="tx">Instead, the principal might decide to increase the amount of instructional time devoted to this
            unit. Rather than spending just 2 weeks on this unit, she decides teachers should spend 4 weeks, stealing
            time from the two units that surround this one in the curriculum pacing guide.</p>
          <p class="tx">Was the decision based on data? Yes. Was it a good one? We&#39;ll have to wait to see what the
            later data reveal. Data-driven decision making has the <em>potential</em> to anchor decisions to evidence,
            but other outcomes are also possible.</p>

      <h2 class="focus"><span class="focus_lbl">Focus Question</span> <span class="focus_q">What are some ways
          legislation has created a high-stakes learning environment?</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">Among other things, legislation such as ESSA seeks to make teachers and schools more accountable.
      </p>

    </div>


    <div class="section-body">

      <h2 class="h2">Assessing Education</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">One way of doing this is to specify the goals of education and lay out minimum educational
          standards that will be acceptable as criteria for reaching these goals. An educational standard is basically a
          description of a required or expected level of knowledge or performance.</p>
        <p class="txt">Another way to encourage schools and teachers to be more accountable is to tie funding directly
          to the performance of students, schools, and, by the same token, teachers. Educational standards described in
          ESSA pertain to attaining proficiency in reading and mathematics, becoming proficient in English, graduating
          from high school, and being taught by highly qualified teachers.</p>
        <p class="key-point">How can you tell if all students have reached the required standards? The simple answer is
          by using tests.</p>
        <p class="txt">As we see in Chapter 10, these tests can have very high stakes, because their consequences can be
          life changing for students, determining whether they pass, can enter a postsecondary program, and receive a
          scholarship. They can also be system changing, especially if federal funds are tied to how well students
          perform on these tests.</p>
      </div>

      <a id="p24"></a>
      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Remembering NCLB</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Under the older NCLB, states were required to set yearly performance targets with a view toward
            reaching certain levels of proficiency within the allotted period. Performance on high-stakes standardized
            tests provided information for <em>data analytic</em> processing, the results of which then allowed the U.S.
            Department of Education to determine how every public school in the country was performing. The consequences
            of not making what was deemed <strong>adequate yearly progress (AYP)</strong> were spelled out by the NCLB.
            These included the possibility of replacing staff, hiring outside consultants, or even transferring
            administrative responsibilities to outside personnel.</p>

          <p class="key-point">With the replacement of the NCLB with ESSA, the notion of AYP is no longer relevant.
            Although schools are still expected to be accountable and reach certain standards, they are no longer
            subject to the same testing procedures or punitive possibilities (Walker, 2015).</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 class="h2">Assessing Teacher Competence</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">The tests used to assess teacher competence have similarly high stakes. A variety of tests are
          used for such purposes, including the edTPA (which stands for Teacher Performance Assessment), developed by
          the Stanford University Center for Assessment, Learning, and Equity, and the Praxis&trade; tests, created by
          <strong>Educational Testing Service</strong>, a nonprofit organization that develops and oversees a variety of
          national and international tests. </p>

        <p class="txt">The Praxis&trade; tests are based on 10 basic principles that describe the skills, attitudes, and
          behaviors thought to be characteristic of the most effective teachers (Table 1.7). The standards of effective
          teaching outlined in Table 1.7 were developed by a consortium of school administrators, the CCSSO, and are
          known as the InTASC principles. InTASC stands for Interstate Teacher Assessment and Support Consortium (CCSSO,
          2017). </p>

        <p class="txt">Many teacher-training institutions use a form of this test, the Praxis I&trade;, as a basis for
          admitting candidates to their teacher-training program. It is designed to assess whether candidates have
          minimum levels of competence in basic skills such as reading, writing, and arithmetic. </p>

        <p class="txt">A second form of the test, the Praxis II&trade;, looks at subject matter knowledge and related
          teaching skills. The Praxis II&trade; is sometimes a requirement for teacher certification.</p>

        <p class="txt">A third form of the test, the Praxis III&trade;, may also be used to determine readiness for full
          teacher certification. It assesses aspects of the teachers&#39; actual classroom performance. Unlike the
          Praxis I&trade; and the Praxis II&trade;, which are almost exclusively computer-delivered tests, the Praxis
          III&trade; uses trained examiners who interview teachers and observe them in their classrooms. Praxis I and
          II&trade; exams are scheduled at specific times and places and require fees. Yearly schedules for testing
          times and locations are available online (e.g., Teachers Test Prep, 2018).</p>

        <h2 class="h2">Remembering Race to the Top</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Announced in 2009, the <strong>Race to the Top (R2T) program</strong> was a federally funded
            ($4.35 billion) competition for funds. It ended 5 years later and gave rise to considerable controversy
            while it was in effect.</p>
          <p class="txt">The R2T funding program was based on the principle of teacher and school accountability. Under
            this program, funds were awarded to school jurisdictions based on points earned for demonstrating
            performance-based standards, complying with national educational standards, promoting <strong>charter
              schools</strong> (publicly funded schools that offer nontraditional school options), and encouraging the
            use of computers in classrooms. The points received reflected things such as the competence of teachers and
            principals, the effectiveness of preparation programs for teachers and principals, progress in raising
            school achievement, and the development of high-quality assessment procedures designed to reflect
            increasingly high standards.</p>
          <p class="txt">The R2T funding program was designed to bring about educational reforms in the areas of
            standards, assessments, teacher qualifications, and low-achieving schools. </p>
          <p class="key-point">One effect of the R2T funding program was that many states adopted common standards that
            reflected the InTASC standards, developed by the CCSSO; others, however, developed their own standards. A
            second outcome was that many states encouraged the formation of more charter schools.</p>
          <p class="txt">However, the R2T funding program was highly controversial. Because only some states
            &quot;won&quot; this funding competition, many of those that &quot;lost&quot; incurred significant
            additional expenses without seeing any corresponding increase in educational funding. As a result, many
            states did not apply for R2T funding or later opted out of the program. In the end, 11 states and the
            District of Columbia were granted R2T funds ranging from $75 million to $700 million each.</p>
          <p class="txt">After the funding period expired in 2015, an evaluation of the program concluded that there had
            been improvements in the four areas of primary concern: higher educational standards, development of
            assessment procedures designed to improve learning and instruction, enhanced teacher qualifications, and
            measurable increases in the achievement levels of lower performing schools (U.S. Department of Education,
            2015b). For example, as shown in Figure 1.5, graduation rates in all R2T states combined showed a trend of
            steady improvement over the 4 years from 2010 to 2014.</p>

    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="key-point, intro">The <strong>Individuals With Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)</strong> has had
        important implications for the assessment of children with special needs.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">The IDEA gave most of the responsibility for identifying and overseeing services for children
          with special needs to <strong>special education teachers</strong> (teachers specifically trained and charged
          with looking after children with special needs).</p>

          <p class="caption">The IDEA provides important guarantees for those with special needs, including
            <em>inclusion</em> in regular classrooms whenever possible and free and appro-priate educational services.

        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="key-point">But the provisions of the IDEA, together with a series of related court decisions, have
          been largely instrumental in revolutionizing how schools assess and deal with <em>exceptionality</em> (a term
          often preferred to <em>disability</em>).</p>

        <p class="txt">Among other things, the law provides important guarantees for children with exceptionalities and
          for their parents (Center for Appropriate Dispute Resolution, 2010). The guarantees include the following:</p>

        <ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">zero rejection and mandated parent participation</li>
          <li class="li_text">education in the least restrictive environment</li>
          <li class="li_text">free and appropriate educational services</li>
          <li class="li_text">fair, nondiscriminatory assessment and due process of law</li>
          <li class="li_text">an individualized education plan (IEP)</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="p28"></a>
        <p class="txt">Although these guarantees were initially intended to apply to learners with special needs, they
          are increasingly being applied to all learners. As a result, it is important for all teachers and educational
          authorities to understand the implications of the IDEA.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Zero Rejection and Mandated Parent Participation</h2>
        <div class="single-column">

          <p class="txt"><em>All</em> children, no matter how severe their disabilities, are entitled to all the
            provisions of the act. That is, each child is entitled to education in the least restrictive environment, to
            nondiscriminatory assessment, to all required educational services at no cost and to an IEP. </p>

          <p class="txt">The guarantee of parent participation grants parents the right to meaningfully participate in
            all aspects of their child&#39;s education, including assessment, the development of IEPs, school placement,
            and transition from school to postsecondary life.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h2 class="h2">Education in the Least Restrictive Environment</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Certain precedent-setting legal decisions have specified that children with disabilities have the
          right to receive an education in the least restrictive environment. This is usually interpreted to mean a
          regular classroom, as opposed to one designated as a &quot;special education&quot; classroom. This
          interpretation has led directly to the practice of <strong>mainstreaming</strong>, or
          <strong>inclusion</strong>, of children with special needs in the regular classroom.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Free and Appropriate Public Education</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Children with special needs must be given optimal educational experiences at public expense.
            These are typically guided by a detailed education plan developed by parents, teachers, and other
            specialists that is specific to each child.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2 class="h2">Fair Evaluation and Due Process</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">The IDEA requires that the identification of children with special needs, and the detailed
          analysis of their needs, be based on a variety of relevant and appropriate assessment procedures. Parents and
          teachers are usually the first to notice that a child might have special needs. The IDEA mandates that
          subsequent assessment be undertaken by trained professionals using nondiscriminatory procedures. One of the
          practical implications of this guarantee is that assessment of learners whose primary language is not English
          must take place in their native language.</p>
      </div>

      <a id="p29"></a>
      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Individualized Education Plans</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt"><strong>Individualized education plans (IEPs)</strong> are written programs that are required
            by law for every child with special needs. They are usually prepared by a team that includes the child&#39;s
            parents, regular classroom teachers, special education teachers, and one or more specialists as required. On
            occasion, the child might also be involved in developing his or her own IEP. </p>

          <p class="txt">The IDEA specifies that IEPs must be written documents that contain the following:</p>
          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">a clear description of the student&#39;s current performance and achievement</li>
            <li class="li_text">a list of short-range objectives and longer term goals</li>
            <li class="li_text">a detailed description of the special services that will be provided for the student
            </li>
            <li class="li_text">the duration of the program</li>
            <li class="li_text">assessment procedures that will be used to evaluate the extent to which goals are being
              met</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="txt">Developing detailed IEPs can be enormously challenging and time consuming. Furthermore,
            carrying out a plan&#39;s provisions&mdash;including assessing the extent to which goals are being met and
            modifying approaches and goals as required&mdash;can be even more challenging. See Table 1.8 for a summary
            of the guarantees explicit in the IDEA and some of their practical implications.</p>

    <div class="section-lead">
      <p class="intro">It was clear from the beginning that Mr. Lowen, a 12th-grade physics teacher, didn&#39;t know
        squat about physics. Yet there were many who flocked to his courses. And although most students were extremely
        bored with his classes, many were quite happy with the inflated grades they took home. </p>

        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">The phrase &quot;teaching to the test&quot; can have two meanings (Figure 1.6). In The more
            common meaning, conspicuous in the case of Mr. Lowen, involves a teacher&#39;s desire to boost marks with no
            concern for reaching instructional objectives. The other meaning refers to instructional procedures aimed
            directly at achieving instructional goals, an approach also expected to result in learners doing well on
            assessments of related educational objectives.</p>

        <a id="p31"></a>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">According to some critics, Mr. Lowen&#39;s approach is one of the by-products of high-stakes
            testing. This would be evident, for example, if Mr. Lowen takes a list of vocabulary words directly from a
            high-stakes state test and teaches only these words to guarantee that his students will score well on the
            test. That illustrates teaching to the test in its most negative sense.</p>
          <p class="txt">In contrast, a teacher might approach vocabulary development in a reading class by helping
            students find and learn new words in hard-to-read texts. That would be teaching to the test in its more
            positive sense. This approach might not guarantee test marks quite as high, but it might go a longer way
            toward achieving instructional goals surrounding literacy and language development. </p>
          <p class="key-point">As we will see in Chapter 10, when teachers feel a great deal of pressure to have their
            students perform well&mdash;and when the consequences of doing so, or not doing so, are
            massive&mdash;instructional and assessment decisions might suffer. </p>
          <p class="txt">Note, however, that with the replacement of the NCLB with ESSA, the use of high-stakes tests
            has diminished and, consequently, the pressure to &quot;teach to the test&quot; is no longer as urgent.</p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <h2 class="h2">The Problem of Bias</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Unfortunately, problems with tests are not limited to teachers coaching their students. </p>
        <p class="key-point">Another problem involves standardized tests that are biased against certain populations and
          groups. </p>
        <p class="txt">For example, there is considerable evidence that children of ethnic minorities are
          underrepresented in the field of giftedness (Liu &amp; Waller, 2018). This bias has sometimes been attributed
          to selection procedures that depend on a teacher&#39;s identification of likely candidates. It may also be
          related to the use of standardized tests that have racial bias built into them. </p>
        <p class="txt">Racial bias in tests may result from the fact that they were developed for majority cultural
          groups. But, as Shuttleworth-Edwards (2016) points out, tests may also be biased when they were developed and
          normed with a huge multicultural population&mdash;as might be the case for tests developed in the United
          States. </p>
        <p class="txt">These tests, explains Shuttleworth-Edwards (2016), may <em>generally</em> represent an entire
          population, but because the population is multicultural, the tests might not be a fair measure for any one of
          the minority cultures that make up the population. They might be biased against some students and unduly favor
          others.</p>
        <p class="txt">The adoption of common standards and assessment procedures in an increasing number of states has
          led many to hope that long-standing cultural differences in achievement&mdash;and perhaps in opportunity as
          well&mdash;may be reduced. As Worrell and Roberson (2016) suggest, the appropriate use of test scores, as well
          as the use of appropriate tests, may go some distance toward achieving that goal.</p>
      </div>

      <a id="p32"></a>
      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2"> Guidelines for the Appropriate Use of Tests</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">There are now guidelines for teachers such as Mr. Lowen, whose assessment practices are less
            than ideal. </p>
          <p class="txt">One set of guidelines was developed by the Joint Committee on Testing Practices (2004), a group
            made up of representatives from the American Psychological Association (APA), the American Counseling
            Association, the American Educational Research Association, the American Speech-Language-Hearing
            Association, the National Association of School Psychologists, the National Association of Test Directors,
            and the National Council on Measurement in Education.</p>
          <p class="key-point">The resulting set of guidelines, called the Code of Fair Testing Practices in Education,
            is intended to apply to all kinds of educational assessment, including paper-and-pencil tests,
            computer-based tests, and performance tests.</p>
          <p class="txt">It is designed to provide guidance for test developers as well as those who use tests. It lists
            specific recommendations with respect to the following areas:</p>

          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">developing and selecting appropriate tests</li>
            <li class="li_text">administering and scoring tests</li>
            <li class="li_text">reporting and interpreting test results</li>
            <li class="li_text">informing test takers about the test, the use of their scores, and their rights and
              responsibilities</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="txt">Given its importance, the code is reprinted in its entirety in Table 2.10 (Chapter 2). Much of
            the information in the part of the table that deals with fair testing practices for <em>test users</em> is
            especially relevant for classroom teachers and school administrators. The part that deals with the
            responsibilities of test developers is most relevant for professional test-development companies, although
            it too has implications for many kinds of teacher-made tests (discussed in Chapter 8).</p>

          <p class="txt">Most educational and psychological organizations have other codes that define ethical&mdash;and
            unethical&mdash;behavior for their members (e.g., the Code of Ethics of the American Educational Research
            Association, 2011). </p>

                <li class="li_text">When assessments are part of a research project, participants&#39; informed consent
                  is generally mandatory. That is, participants must understand the implications and possible
                  consequences of the assessment and must be free to refuse it without coercion or fear of reprisal. By
                  definition, being a student in school or college constitutes implied consent with respect to normal
                  educational testing procedures.</li>

                  parents. Given the limited reliability of many of these tests, and because of the implications of the
                  labels often attached to their results, these should not always be fully disclosed.</li>

      <h2 class="h2">Teacher Responsibilities</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Without a doubt, teachers have important responsibilities relating to assessment. These include
          choosing or developing assessments that are appropriate for <em>what</em> as well as for <em>whom</em> they
          are intended.</p>
        <p class="key-point">This means that assessment instruments, procedures, and strategies need to reflect intended
          instructional goals and that they must also be free of cultural, social class, or religious bias.</p>
        <p class="txt">When required, assessments must also be appropriate for learners with special needs.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Testing Fairly</h3>
        <p class="txt">As we will see in Chapter 2, one of the most important characteristics of educational assessments
          from the student&#39;s point of view is that they be fair&mdash;or at least, seem to the learner to be fair.
          That chapter also describes how assessments need to be valid (their interpretations and uses must be supported
          by evidence) and provide accurate and consistent measurements (that is, they need to be reliable). Teachers
          are responsible for ensuring that assessment procedures are as fair, valid, and reliable as possible.</p>


        <h3 class="h3">Scoring and Using Results</h3>
        <p class="txt">Teachers also have key responsibilities relating to scoring, interpreting, reporting, and using
          assessment procedure results (Chapter 11). Scoring a test and interpreting its results should be an accurate
          and unbiased process. Furthermore, the results of a single assessment should never be the basis for major
          decisions.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Communicating Results</h3>
        <p class="txt">Finally, teachers are responsible for communicating assessment results to students, parents, and
          school administrators. It is important that teachers understand the limitations and significance of their
          assessments. It is also important that teachers help learners and parents interpret test results and
          understand their meaning.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Among their responsibilities are obvious requirements, such as showing up to school or exams at
          the appointed place and time; acquiring educational materials as needed; making an earnest effort to
          participate and learn; and being honest and ethical in completing assignments and taking tests, and avoiding
          plagiarism and other forms of cheating.</p>

        <h2 class="h2">The Right to an Education</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Student rights vary considerably throughout the world. As discussed, ESSA and the IDEA specify
            that in the United States, all students have the right to a &quot;free and appropriate&quot; education, to
            be taught by highly qualified teachers, and to be taught in such a way that will ensure that all students
            reach a minimum level of proficiency in reading, writing, and arithmetic and graduate from high school. </p>
          <p class="txt">Although the probability that all students will fulfill these ideals is low, that each should
            have a legitimate opportunity to do so is really the most important goal.</p>

        </figcaption>

      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Within certain legal limits, students in U.S. schools also have rights relating to freedom of
          expression and of assembly. In the event of a grievance, they also have a right to due process of law. </p>

        <p class="txt">A declaration of students&#39; rights, adopted by the general assembly of the Organising Bureau
          of European School Student Unions, also stipulates that all students should have a right to the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="bl">
          <li class="li_text">a legally recognized school council</li>
          <li class="li_text">participation in important school decisions, including the content of lectures, selection

          <li class="li_text">high-quality education (Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions, 2014).</li>
        </ul>

        <a id="p35"></a>
        <p class="txt">Similar rights are expressed in the Student Bill of Rights adopted by the United States Student
          Association (2012). Student bills of rights most commonly include the rights to free expression, safety and
          well-being, due process, personal learning, and privacy, as well as statements regarding the right to
          employability, civic participation, inclusion, fair assessment, and preparation for technology (Martin, 2015).
          Some of these rights are discussed below. </p>
      </div>
      <div style="clear:both;">&nbsp;</div>

      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">The Right to Privacy</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">Recently, student privacy has come under increased scrutiny as organizations look for ways to
            improve education or market products using student data (Vance, 2018). More and more states have been
            passing student privacy laws, many of which guarantee the individual&#39;s right to confidentiality with
            respect to personal information. Determining whether this includes test results is an important issue for
            educators.</p>

          <p class="txt">The <strong>Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)</strong> is the U.S. federal law
            that protects students&#39; right to privacy (U.S. Department of Education, 2018b). Its main provisions
            include the following:</p>

          <ul class="bl">
            <li class="li_text">giving students access to their education records</li>
            <li class="li_text">providing an opportunity for students to petition to have records changed if they think
              these are unfair or inaccurate</li>
            <li class="li_text">granting students some control over the disclosure of personal information</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="txt">In practice, the law generally requires schools to get written permission from students or
            their parents (or other adults legally responsible for them) to release to a third party any
            &quot;protected&quot; information from student records (&quot;third party&quot; does not include the student
            or the student&#39;s parents). </p>
        </div>



        <div class="single-column">
          <h3 class="h3">Protected Information</h3>
          <p class="txt">Protected information includes educational information, directory information, and personally
            identifiable information, each of which is subject to different limitations. For example, personally
            identifiable information can only be disclosed after obtaining a signed document (from the parent or student
            if the student is over 18) that specifies to whom the information will be released and for what purpose.
          </p>

          <p class="txt">In contrast, release of directory information, such as a list of student names and phone
            numbers, is not normally considered an invasion of privacy and is permitted under FERPA. However, the
            disclosure of this type of information is subject to the student&#39;s or caregiver&#39;s right to prohibit
            it (Hlavac &amp; Easterly, 2015). </p>

          <a id="p36"></a>
          <h3 class="h3">Formal Records Versus Informal Grading</h3>
          <p class="txt">This law applies to formal school records; however, it does not apply to informal grading in
            school. For example, a fourth-grade teacher is not in violation of privacy rights when he hangs an informal
            chart indicating the number of assignments each student has turned in or puts stars on the chart to indicate
            how well the assignments were done. </p>

          <p class="txt">Yet he would be in violation of privacy laws if he reported how Joshua did on his arithmetic
            test to, say, his Aunt Miri&mdash;unless she is his &quot;authorized representative&quot; as defined by the
            act (usually a parent or legal guardian), or unless the parents or legal guardians have granted express and
            informed consent that she be given that information. </p>

          <p class="txt">And if Joshua were 18 or older, teachers and postsecondary educators would be in violation of
            his legal right to privacy were they to divulge, even to a parent, any protected information in his records
            without his consent.</p>

          <h3 class="h3">Other Appropriate Uses of Information</h3>

          <p class="txt">FERPA does not require that school records, test results, and other private information be
            available only to teachers, school administrators, parents, and students. The law also stipulates that
            student information may be used for funding applications, research, or other legitimate purposes as long as
            a student identifier system protecting the individual identity of each student is used.</p>

          <p class="txt">The results of various student assessments sometimes need to be shared among individuals and
            institutions for what are considered legally defensible&mdash;and sometimes legally mandated&mdash;purposes.
            For example, the IDEA often requires information that might otherwise be considered private and confidential
            to be shared at least among all who are involved in developing IEPs for those children. That doing so is
            legitimate and legally defensible seems clear. </p>

          <p class="txt">Less clear, however, are the privacy rights issues surrounding the identification of children
            with special needs. Whenever someone is identified as being in need of special educational services, that
            person&#39;s record is essentially being flagged and brought to the attention of a variety of people. This
            practice might have serious, life-changing consequences for the individual involved, and it might also
            violate his or her privacy rights. Schools need to be especially mindful of the potential to misidentify and
            mislabel children. </p>

          <h3 class="h3">Informed Consent</h3>
          <p class="txt"><em> Informed consent</em> implies three conditions:</p>
          <ol class="nl">
            <li class="li_text">that parents (or mature students) be fully informed about why and how personal
              information will be collected and used, or how and why research will be conducted</li>
            <li class="li_text">that they have the capacity to accept or refuse to participate</li>
            <li class="li_text">that accepting or refusing be entirely voluntary without fear of penalty or reprisal
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p class="txt">The notion of informed consent is especially relevant in educational and psychological
            research, much of which involves learners of different ages and characteristics. With respect to such
            research, both children and their parents have the right to be fully informed regarding the research.
            Furthermore, investigators must obtain both the child&#39;s consent and the written permission of the
            parents or legal guardians. </p>

          accomplishments, and our failures. We discover how to compare our actions, our gifts, and our failings to
          those of others. We develop notions of how things should be or how we would like them to be. We build up
          personal standards that we can now use to become judges of our own strengths and weaknesses.</p>

          <p class="txt">Being a self-regulated learner requires developing the skills of
            <strong>metacognition</strong>&mdash;knowing about knowing (see Chapter 3). Metacognitive skills provide
            learners ways to estimate the effects of their efforts. They help learners develop strategies for learning
            and remembering, problem solving, and self-assessment. Research supports the notion that strong
            self-assessment skills contribute to effective learning (Maxlow, 2017; Sharma et al., 2016).</p>

        <p class="txt">Students&#39; self-assessments&mdash;their personal notions about their progress and
          achievements, and about their strengths and weaknesses&mdash;are based on a number of factors. </p>

        <p class="key-point">For example, the information learners receive from peers and teachers about how well they

      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Some of this information is derived from the formal and informal assessment procedures that
          schools and teachers provide. </p>

        <p class="key-point">In addition, comparisons that students make between themselves and others is also a rich
          source of information about self-competence.</p>

        <p class="txt">Self-assessments may reflect a range of sometimes subtle influences, including personality
          characteristics. Some people are naturally confident, have high opinions of themselves, and have a strong
          sense of their ability to succeed. Others, not so much.</p>

        <a id="p39"></a>
        <p class="txt">One purpose of educational assessment is to foster the skills involved in self-assessment. Some
          students learn and use those skills exceptionally well; they can realistically appraise their abilities and
          their weaknesses, and they use their self-appraisals wisely to guide their efforts. Others are prone to
          self-assessments that exaggerate their gifts&mdash;or that depreciate them. Do those of us afflicted with poor
          self-assessment skills ever learn that we do not really know ourselves? That we really are far more gifted
          than we believe? Or&mdash;surely not&mdash;less?</p>

      <p class="intro">There is no simple answer to what works in education.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section-body">
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Historically, there have been a wide range of beliefs about what learning is and a sometimes
          bewildering assortment of recommendations about the best ways to go about the teaching/learning process. A
          huge amount of research has been undertaken to assess the value of these many recommendations. Although the
          results of this research have not always been clear and without controversy, recent summaries and analyses of
          this research have begun to answer the question, <em>What works</em>? </p>
      </div>


      <div class="inner-section">
        <h2 class="h2">Formative Assessment and Feedback Work</h2>
        <div class="single-column">
          <p class="txt">What works, research informs us, is assessment that is designed <em>for</em> learning rather
            than simply <em>of</em> learning. It is assessment that is conducted <em>for</em> learners rather than
            simply <em>to</em> learners. </p>
          <p class="key-point">In brief, it is formative assessment (Craig &amp; Orland-Barak, 2015; Maxlow, 2017).</p>
          <p class="txt">Good formative assessment reflects the processes involved in the backward design approach to
            curriculum and assessment shown in Figure 1.3, as well as the assessment cycle illustrated in Figure 1.4.
            That is, formative assessment requires</p>

          <ol class="nl">
            <li class="li_text">knowing where you want learners to arrive (curriculum/lesson/unit goals),</li>
            <li class="li_text">finding or devising assessments to determine whether they have reached desired goals,
            </li>
            <li class="li_text">planning and implementing appropriate learning experiences, and</li>
            <li class="li_text">using ongoing assessments to assist the learner and to modify instructional approaches.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p class="key-point">Although teachers have traditionally assumed responsibility for each of these processes,
            current research suggests that learners need to be centrally involved at all stages.</p>
          <p class="txt">This means that learners, like teachers, need to understand learning objectives, and they need
            to know what the criteria for success are. It also means that they need to collaborate with their teachers
            and their peers to select and carry out the learning tasks that will move them toward relevant instructional
            objectives. </p>

          <a id="p40"></a>
          <p class="txt">As we see in Chapter 5, feedback (information learners receive about their performance) is the
            cornerstone of formative assessment. </p>
          <p class="key-point">One of the key factors in learner achievement has to do with the decisions teachers make
            in the classroom on a minute-to-minute basis and on which assessment and learning strategies are employed.
          </p>
          <p class="txt">Teachers have the professional responsibility to be aware of and use the best of all possible
            instructional practices. Formative assessment&mdash;assessment <em>for</em> learning&mdash;is one of those
            &quot;best&quot; practices. </p>

      <h2 class="h2">Data Mining to Discover What Works</h2>
      <div class="single-column">
        <p class="txt">Technology provides educators with new ways to package and deliver educational offerings, develop
          and administer assessment procedures, and even to make new discoveries about what works.</p>
        <p class="txt"><strong>Data mining</strong> in education is basically the mining of educational databases to
          uncover and organize information that might be useful in the educational endeavor. </p>
        <p class="txt">As Bakhshinategh, Zaiane, ElAtia, and Ipperciel (2018) point out, there are now a large number of
          online courses, intelligent tutoring systems, and learning management systems that have accumulated vast
          amounts of data relating to learner reactions to problems, conversations among and between learners and
          instructors, and test performance patterns. </p>
        <p class="key-point">Mining and analyzing some of this data may yield surprisingly useful ideas for designing
          curricula, improving assessments, and modifying instruction. </p>
        <p class="txt">Data mining in education has been used for <em>student modeling</em>, the process of analyzing
          and representing learner characteristics; for assistance in making decisions such as those relating to
          feedback, lesson sequencing, questioning, and other aspects of instruction; and for improving computer-based
          instructional systems and approaches to evaluation. </p>
        <p class="txt">Most of this data mining is carried out not by teachers but by educational researchers. Teachers
          then have access to the fruits of these mining labors, many of which are published in journal articles.</p>
        <p class="txt">A search of educational and computer-related literature reveals enormous current interest in
          practical educational applications of technology and data mining (see Chapter 3). For example, Cho and Yoo
          (2017) report using a data-mining approach to study online self-regulated learning. Developing self-regulated,
          highly motivated learners is an enormously important task. But how can we accomplish this? The feature box
          <em>In the Classroom: Strategies to Improve </em><em>Motivation and Learning</em> lists a number of
          suggestions, many of which are recurring themes in this text.</p>

        <h3 class="h3"> Types of Assessments</h3>

        <p class="txt">Historically, the main purpose of educational assessment was to provide a grade (<em>summative
          </em><em>assessment</em>); increasingly, assessment has become an integral part of the day-to-day functioning
          of schools, where it is used to provide feedback for guiding and improving teaching and learning
          (<em>formative assessment</em>: assessment <em>for</em> learning rather than assessment <em>of</em> learning).
          <em>Placement assessment</em> gathers information useful for placing students in courses, programs, study
          groups, and so on. <em>Performance-based assessment</em>, unlike many paper-and-pencil or computer-based
          tests, asks learners to <em>perform</em> or <em>construct</em> what is being assessed. In education,
          <em>tests</em> are usually specific instruments or procedures used to measure achievement and progress;
          <em>assessment</em> is a more general term for all the activities involved in educational testing and
          measurement. <em>Evaluation</em> refers to making a <em>value</em> judgment or appraising something relative
          to certain criteria.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Curriculum Planning and Assessment</h3>
        <p class="txt">Students tend to study what teachers test and (hopefully) teach; hence the importance of
          educational assessment that measures the intentions (educational goals) of educational systems. The <em>Every
            Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)</em> is the principal piece of legislation governing K&ndash;12 education in the
          United States. It stipulates that all states must develop high educational standards (goals or objectives) and
          appropriate related assessments and approaches to instruction. The <em>backward design approach</em> to
          curriculum building&mdash;in which the first step identifies standards (goals), the next relates to developing
          assessments to determine progress toward goals, and the third deals with instructional approaches&mdash;is
          highly useful in this regard. Collaboration, often in the form of <em>professional learning communities
            (PLCs)</em>, is frequently involved at all stages of the curriculum-building process, including the sharing
          of standards and approaches to assessment and instruction. For assessment and instructional purposes, the most
          useful learning objectives are framed as highly explicit, observable, intended outcomes of instructional
          activities.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">The Implications of Current Legislation</h3>
        <p class="txt">Mandates of ESSA relating to high standards, appropriate assessments, and optimal approaches to
          instruction have led to increased emphasis on the use of <em>common core stan</em><em>dards</em> across
          states, often developed by a consortium of educators. This legislation typically results in the use of
          statewide standardized tests, the results of which have important implications for learners, teachers,
          schools, and educational funding, leading to the label <em>high-stakes </em><em>testing</em>. Assessment of
          teacher competence, often with the Praxis&trade; tests, is another form of high-stakes testing&mdash;as was
          assessment and funding based on the now terminated <em>Race to </em><em>the Top (R2T) program</em>, which
          granted funds on the basis of school and teacher performance. The <em>Individuals With Disabilities Education
            Act (IDEA)</em> also has implications for testing. It outlines the school&#39;s responsibilities with
          respect to providing services for children with special needs. It guarantees <em>zero rejection</em>,
          <em>parent participation</em>, education in the <em>least restrictive envi</em><em>ronment</em>, <em>free and
            appropriate education</em>, <em>fair evaluation</em>, and <em>individual education plans (IEPs)</em> for all
          learners with special needs.</p>

        <a id="p43"></a>
        <h3 class="h3">Test Fairness and the Ethics of Assessment</h3>
        <p class="txt">Both formal and informal assessments can be unfair, racially biased, invalid, and unethical. Most
          professional organizations in education and psychology have developed codes of <em>fair</em> and
          <em>ethical</em> practices in assessment. A consortium of such organizations has developed a set of guidelines
          for constructing and selecting tests, administering them, and interpreting and using their results. These
          guidelines underscore that teachers are responsible for choosing and developing tests that are fair,
          appropriate, and unbiased as well as valid and reliable. Often, they also attempt to codify student rights,
          which vary considerably throughout the world. In the United States these rights are often implicit in
          legislation such as the IDEA, ESSA, and FERPA, as well as in relevant court decisions. They include the right
          to an education as well as important informed consent, privacy, and nondisclosure rights.</p>

        <h3 class="h3">Self-Assessment</h3>
        <p class="txt">One important function of formal and informal educational assessment is to promote the skills of
          self-assessment, which are critical for learning how to learn. These skills require knowing about knowing
          (<em>metacognition</em>) and allow learners to guide and control their own learning (<em>self-regulated
            learning</em>). Sources of information important for self-assessment include comparisons learners make
          between themselves and peers, their performance in formal and informal testing situations, and personality
          variables.</p>


        <h3 class="h3">What Works in Education</h3>
        <p class="txt">Extensive research in education suggests that the best strategies and approaches emphasize the
          formative functions of assessment. Applying formative assessment requires frequent, brief, collaborative,
          ongoing assessment designed to provide immediate feedback for teachers and learners. It is based on several
          crucial steps: knowing where you want learners to arrive, finding assessments to determine whether they reach
          these goals, planning and implementing appropriate learning experiences, and using ongoing assessments to
          continually fine-tune the teaching/learning process. Data mining might yield surprisingly useful information
          for curriculum planning, assessment, and instruction.</p>
