      <p>The terms <em>summative</em>, <em>formative</em>, <em>diagnostic</em>, and
        <em>placement</em> refer to how assessment is used rather than to different kinds of assessment
        procedures. In each case, assessment might be structured and formal or highly informal. Although an
        assessment procedure might seem mainly summative, formative, or intended for placement decisions, the
        overriding purpose of educational assessment is to improve student learning.
